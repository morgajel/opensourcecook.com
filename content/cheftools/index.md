If you haven&#8217;t been able to tell yet, I love to cook. Playing with a recipe can be so much fun and once you find something that works for you, it makes cooking and baking that much easier.  That&#8217;s what makes a cook excel in the kitchen &#8211; great tools that make it easy to put a meal on the table.  I have a great source for some really awesome tools and I would love to share them with you.  If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, shoot me an email at myjaxon AT gmail DOT com.  I would tell you what they are, but at this time, I&#8217;m not allowed to say what that company is.  They have something against advertising on the internet.
