This is actually a really quick and easy dessert to make. You can actually use any kind of peach you want (fresh, frozen, or canned), but I ended up using diced canned peaches and it worked out really well. Sliced peaches are fine, but then you have to mess with cutting the peaches while you&#8217;re trying to eat it and that can be a pain. Using the diced peaches worked perfectly because they were already to eat and no cutting was involved.

The original recipe used toffee chips and my mother uses white chocolate chips, however, I use the semi-sweet chips and they add a very nice bittersweet taste that balances well with the peachy taste well. The recipe makes an 8&#215;8 pan and, according to Jesse&#8217;s portions, probably about 5 servings. ðŸ™‚ At least, Ian and I only got two servings each and Jesse ate the rest.

One other thing I should mention, I can&#8217;t remember what the original recipe said, but I doubled the amounts for the crisp topping. I really like the crisp topping and this had the perfect amount for me, so if you&#8217;re not a fan of the crisp, you can easily cut the amounts in half without hurting anything.

Jesse did want me to mention that he wasn&#8217;t crazy about the peaches I used. The diced part was great, but he said there was a taste to the peaches that he didn&#8217;t like. His exact words are &#8220;they had a funky taste to them.&#8221; However, when I made them again, I used both sliced and diced peaches and he didn&#8217;t complain about an after taste with that mixture. And it still worked out really well.

This is a good recipe to try with different fruits.

**Ingredients:**  
3 cans peaches with light syrup  
1-1/3 cups instant oats  
1/2 cup brown sugar  
1 cup Bisquick  
1/2 cup chocolate chips  
1/2 cup butter or margarine  
2 tsp cinnamon

**Directions:**

  1. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Spread peaches in ungreased square pan, 8x8x2 inches.
  2. Mix remaining ingredients until crumbly; sprinkle over peaches.
  3. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until peaches are tender and topping is golden brown. Serve warm.

**Variation:** Substitute sliced peeled all-purpose apples for the peaches; substitute toffee bits for any kind of chocolate chip; substitute blueberries (or other fruit) for peaches.

**Substitution for bisquick:** 1/2 cup bisquick = 1/2 cup flour + 1 tsp baking powder + dash of salt
