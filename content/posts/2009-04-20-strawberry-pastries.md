I&#8217;m doing a show for my cousin on Friday and she had this recipe she wanted to do again.  It had been done at a previous party and she really liked them and since I haven&#8217;t had them yet, I said why now.  The recipe comes from [the Pampered Chef][1] and it came out really well.

I did forget to separate the pastries squares after cutting them and before baking them.  I ended up with some odd edges, but nothing that prevented me from doing what needed to be done.  I also found that going overboard on the strawberries can make them a little overpowering, but nothing I didn&#8217;t enjoy.  Thankfully, I tried one before I got finish filling them all and did cut back on the number of strawberries I was adding to the centers.  Overall, this is really an easy and pretty dessert to make if you&#8217;re looking to impress someone.

However, while this was good, I thought the whipped cream and strawberries were a little boring, so I started brainstorming.  I began thinking of the [Strawberry Cream Trifle][2] recipe and the pudding mixture it has &#8211; yogurt, cheesecake pudding and whipped cream.  Simple to make and yet might add something to this.  Give it a little zing.  C&#8217;mon, cheesecake is always good.

_Added after tasting the creation_:  I&#8217;m not sure what I think.  I&#8217;m thinking I can&#8217;t substitute milk for yogurt with the whipped mixture or if I do, then I need to let the mixture set longer than an hour.  The whipped mixture came out a lot runnier than I would have liked.  I am going to try it with yogurt next time (plain of course) and see if that made the difference or not.  Plus, I&#8217;m not crazy about the cheesecake pudding flavor.  It was off in my opinion and I think it would have came out better if I did chocolate pudding with chocolate Cool-Whip with plain yogurt.  Maybe.  I&#8217;m taking it to a gathering tonight, so we&#8217;ll see how it goes.

## Strawberry Cheesecake Pastries

Here&#8217;s the experiment I did.  I took the recipe from above and added the pudding mixture from the [Strawberry Cream Trifle][2] recipe; but I did change one ingredient, but only because I didn&#8217;t have any on hand.  Instead of the 3 containers (8oz) blended strawberry yogurt mixed with the pudding and whipped cream, I simply used 1 cup of milk instead.   Because I used something that is a little thinner than yogurt, I refrigerated the mixture for an hour to let the pudding set up a bit.  Next time, I do plan on using the yogurt instead of the milk, but we&#8217;ll have to see how this comes out first.

**Ingredients:**  
1/2 pkg frozen puff pastry sheets (1 sheet), thawed  
1/4 cup sliced almonds, finely chopped  
1 tbsp sugar  
1-1/2 cups thawed, frozen whipped topping  
12 large strawberries, sliced  
1 lemon or 2 tbsp lemon juice  
1 cup milk  
1 pkg (3.4oz) cheesecake instant pudding and pie filling  
1 container (8oz) frozen whipped topping, thawed, divided

 **Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Unfold pastry sheet onto flat baking stone. Combine almonds and sugar; sprinkle over dough. Lightly press almond mixture into dough.
  2. Using Pastry Cutter, cut dough lengthwise into three strips; cut strips crosswise into four squares for a total of 12 squares. Separate squares evenly over baking stone. Bake 16-18 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from oven; cool completely.
  3. Juice lemon using Juicer to measure 2 tbsp juice. In Stainless (4-qt.) Mixing Bowl, whisk lemon juice, yogurt and pudding mix until smooth using Stainless Whisk; immediately fold in 1 cup of the whipped topping. Refrigerate 1 hour.
  4. Split open cooled pastry squares; arrange half of the strawberries over bottoms of shells. Top with whipped mixture, remaining strawberries and tops of pastry shells.

**Yield:** 12 pastries

## Strawberry Pastries &#8211; 2nd version

_Added 4/28/09_: So I had Adrian&#8217;s show this past weekend and we found out that we had two different pastry recipes. Her recipe actually came out a lot better, although eye balling the sour cream isn&#8217;t necessarily a good thing.

**Ingredients:**  
1 box puffed pastry (frozen foods section)  
1/2 cup sliced almonds  
8oz sour cream  
1/2 cup splenda or sugar  
1/4 teaspoon almond extract  
1 1/2 cup cool whip (sugar free or not)

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Unfold pastry sheet onto flat baking stone. Combine almonds and sugar; sprinkle over dough. Lightly press almond mixture into dough.
  2. Cut dough lengthwise into three strips; cut strips crosswise into four squares for a total of 12 squares. Separate squares evenly over baking stone. Bake 12-16 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from oven; cool completely.
  3. Mix sour cream, splenda and almond extract.  Gently fold in cool whip. Once pastry is cooled cut in half then layer, strawberries, scoop of filling, then sprinkle with almonds. Place top pastry over filling.
