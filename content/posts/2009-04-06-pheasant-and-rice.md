This recipes comes from Lewis Drullinger, in the [_Essential Game Bird Recipes_][1] by Pheasants Forever.

**Ingredients:**  
1/2 cup oil  
2 pheasant breasts  
1/4 cup milk or 1 beaten egg  
1/2 cup all-purpose seasoning flour.

**Directions:**

  1. Put oil in fry pan and heat.
  2. Dip breasts in milk or egg, roll in seasoning flour, and fry until brown.
  3. Heat through and serve over brown rice made according to package directions.

**Yields:** 4

**Tips:** This recipe does come with directions for a gravy, but I had no clue what _Kitchen Bouquet_ was, so I didn&#8217;t include it. If you do, here are the supplemental directions. Mix together 1 cup water, 1/2 cup plum water, 2 tbsp Kitchen Bouquet, and 1 can (8oz) mushrooms, drained. Heat throughly.

In the directions for the pheasants, it does say to use the juice from the drained mushrooms to the fry pan an them steam the breasts until done. This gives you the liquid for the gravy. Again, I have no clue what _Kitchen bouquet_ is, so if anyone does, I would like to know.
