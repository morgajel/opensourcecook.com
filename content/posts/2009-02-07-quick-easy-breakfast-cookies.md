This was one of those &#8220;why not&#8221; moments I had awhile ago.  The three of us tend to have pancakes pretty regularly, but we always have leftover batter.  Before, I would end up making up the batter and/or throwing it away because no one liked cold or reheated pancakes.  Then I got the idea of adding jam to the leftover batter and making silver dollar pancakes.  Ian loves these.  They are small enough to be great snacks or I can give him a couple at time for lunch.  The best part is, I don&#8217;t have to heat them up.  Ian loves them straight out of the ziploc bag.   During one weekend I made these, I noticed he kept going into the kitchen and helping himself to the &#8220;cake cakes&#8221;.  That is what he calls them &#8211; either _cake cakes_ or _cookies_.

The one thing you have to watch is the batter thickness.  If you like thick pancakes, then this recipe will work beautifully for you; however, if you like thin pancakes, you&#8217;ll probably need to add more Bisquick.  Once you add the jam, it will thin the batter, which works for the cookies since you want them thin instead of thick.  I&#8217;ve tried cherry, strawberry and raspberry jams with this recipe and Ian has loved them all.  I generally use whatever I have in the fridge, so there really is no limitations on flavors.

Another variation on this recipe is to use fruit instead of jam.  I have done that in the past as well.  Just like with the [Fruit Pancakes][1], once you&#8217;re done with dinner, simple make the silver dollar pancakes, maybe adding a little more fruit depending on how much you have in the batter to begin with, and viola.

**Ingredients**:  
2 cups Bisquick  
1/2 cup egg product or 2 eggs  
3/4 to 1 cup milk  
2 heaping tbsp of jelly or jam

**Directions:**

  1. Heat griddle or skillet over medium-high heat or electric griddle to 375°F; grease with cooking spray, vegetable oil or shortening. (Surface is ready when a few drops of water sprinkled on it dance and disappear.)
  2. Stir all ingredients until blended. Pour by spoonful onto hot griddle.
  3. Cook until edges are dry. Turn; cook until golden.
