This recipe is one of the few that actually make a lot! For our holiday baking, we were going to do 6 batches of all the cookies we were making since they were being divided up between 4 of us. Well, we only did a triple batch of this recipe and ended up with over 180 cookies. There were a lot, so if you&#8217;re looking for something that makes a lot and only want to make one batch, then you should try this recipe.

2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour  
1 tsp baking soda

1/4 tsp ground cloves  
1/2 cup butter or margarine  
1-1/2 cups sugar  
1 egg, beaten  
4 to 6 tbsp black molasses  
1 tsp fresh lemon juice

  3. With an electric mixer, cream together the butter or margarine and two-thirds of the sugar.
  4. Stir in the egg, molasses and lemon juice. Add the flour mixture and mix in thoroughly with a wooden spoon to make a soft dough.
  5. Shape the dough into 1/4 inch balls. Roll the balls in the remaining sugar and place them about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking trays.
