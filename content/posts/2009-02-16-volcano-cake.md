Jesse does refer to it as &#8220;the ugly cake&#8221; because it does kind of ooze when you invert the cake, but it&#8217;s really good.  The cake is moist and soft and completely cooked.  Then you have melted frosting covering the cake and pouring down the sides.  It&#8217;s delicious.

For my first time making this, I used a butter pecan cake mix with chocolate frosting and the combination worked well together.  I will be honest, I wasn&#8217;t sure how they would taste, but the flavors compliment each other well.  They worked so well together, Ian actually licked his plate clean.

1 Chocolate Cake Mix  
1 can of Deluxe Chocolate Icing  
3 Eggs  
Oil (as per recipe on cake mix box)  
Water (as per recipe on cake mix box)

**Directions:**

  1. Take the white insert out of the rice cooker and set aside.  Place the cake mix and all ingredients in the rice cooker and mix completely using a stainless whisk.
  2. Place 2/3 of a tub of store bought icing on top of the cake mix &#8211; _**do not mix in**_.
  3. Attach the top of the rice cooker (without the clear plastic piece) and place in the microwave for 8-9 minutes &#8211; if you have a newer microwave 8 will be enough.
  4. When the cake is done, let it set for a minute with the lid on.  Remove the lid and place a medium plate with a lip on it (very important) and flip.  It should come right out and the icing will coat the cake &#8211; the frosting will ooze from center of cake making the effect of a Volcano.

  <strong>Cook Notes: </strong>This works with any 9&#215;13 size cake mix and any store bought frosting, except for Angel Food cake.
