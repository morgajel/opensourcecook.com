I&#8217;m always looking for a good pizza dough since pizza is a really easy meal to make at night (and far healthier than ordering delivery). Nikki, who has been sending me a lot of recipes lately, has said this is a great one for at home pizzas since it only takes about 15 minutes for the dough to rise.

## Basic Pizza Dough

(1001 Low-Fat Vegetarian Recipes)  
6 slices = 100 calories/0.3g fat/3.2 g protein/20g carbs

**Ingredients:**  
1-1/4 cup all-purpose flour  
1 package fast-rising yeast  
1/2 tsp sugar  
1/4 tsp salt  
1/2 cup very hot water (120 deg)

**Directions:**

  1. Combine 3/4 cup flour, yeast, sugar, & salt in a bowl. Add hot water, stirring until smooth. Mix enough of remaining 1/2 cup of flour to make a soft dough.
  2. Knead on a floured surface until smooth & elastic (3-5 minutes). Cover dough with the bowl and let stand for 15 minutes.
  3. Spread dough on the pan, add toppings, & cook 20 minutes at 425 deg.

## Whole Wheat Pizza Dough

(From 1001 Low-Fat Vegetarian Recipes)  
6 slices = 101 calories/0.3g fat/3.5 g protein/21g carbs

**Ingredients:**  
3/4 cup all-purpose flour  
1/2 cup whole wheat flour  
1 package fast-rising yeast  
1/4 tsp salt  
2 tsp honey  
1/2 cup very hot water (120 deg)

**Directions:**

  1. Combine all-purpose flour, yeast, & salt in a bowl. Add water and stir until smooth. Mix enough of the whole wheat flour in to make a soft dough.
  2. Knead on a floured surface until smooth & elastic (3-5 minutes). Cover dough with the bowl and let stand for 15 minutes.
  3. Spread dough on the pan, add toppings, & cook 20 minutes at 425 deg.
