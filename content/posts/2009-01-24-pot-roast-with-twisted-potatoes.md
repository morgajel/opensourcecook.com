Pot roast is such an easy meal to make since it requires little effort to get it going and it cooks all day. The only problem we run into is what to do with all the veggies that are placed in the slow cooker to help flavor the beef. Usually, I serve them as a side dish, but no one tends to eat them. This time, I&#8217;m trying something a little different. Instead of putting in one type of potato, I&#8217;m using both the standard Idaho potato and a sweet potato; then I&#8217;m going to mash them. So essentially, I&#8217;ll be serving mashed potatoes with dinner with a few surprises (yes, I&#8217;ll be keeping the green peppers and the onions in the potatoes while I mash them). I&#8217;m not completely sure if this will work or not, but we&#8217;ll find out tonight when I try it.

I&#8217;m not a huge fan of the sweet potato, but a little of it I can do. I&#8217;m hoping, that mixing it with another potato will still keep the flavor of it, but won&#8217;t make it as sweet. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to say, but that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking.

So that&#8217;s our dinner plans for tonight. I&#8217;ll let you know how it turns out after dinner.

_Edited to Add:_ So the roast came out beautifully tonight.  The only glitch was the potatoes and that was only because I forgot out watery sweet potatoes can be. When you&#8217;re making mashed potatoes out of sweet potatoes, there&#8217;s no need to add milk since there is already a high liquid content; you only need the butter to help smooth them out.  Otherwise, the potatoes came out just as good.  I did add an extra potato (that I boiled for 30 minutes) to the veggie mixture from the slow cooker because I didn&#8217;t want the sweet potato to overpower the other potato.  Next time, I think I&#8217;m going to either cut the sweet potato in half or add a couple more potatoes at the end.  There was too much sweet potato for me, but I&#8217;m not a fan of them either.  Regardless, dinner came out great tonight and this is one I&#8217;m going to have again.

**Ingredients:**  
2 lbs of bottom round roast beef  
1 Idaho potato, chopped  
1 sweet potato, chopped  
1/2 of a green bell pepper, diced  
1/2 of an onion, diced  
1 (10.5oz) can of beef broth (+ 1 can of water _optional_)  
Rosemary  
Thyme  
Pepper  
Garlic Salt  
2 Idaho potatoes, chopped  
2 tbsp butter

**Directions:**

  1. Add the green peppers, onions, potatoes and seasonings to the slow cooker.  Place the bottom round roast on top.  Pour beef broth and water over the top and cook on HIGH for 5-6 hours.
  2. Boil the 2 potatoes 30 minutes before you&#8217;re ready to serve the roast.
  3. Once it&#8217;s done, separate the roast beef from the veggies.  Drain any excess water from the veggies and place in a bowl.  Add butter and boiled potatoes and blend until smooth and creamy.
