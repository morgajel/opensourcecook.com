Since it&#8217;s the holidays, I thought I would put up my Grandma Britten&#8217;s cider recipe (that and I&#8217;m getting ready to make it). I love this recipe and it&#8217;s an old holiday tradition, one I&#8217;m always looking forward to.

**Ingredients:**  
1 gallon cider  
1/2 cup orange juice  
1/4 cup lemon juice  
2 tbsp sugar  
3 cinnamon sticks  
1-1/2 tsp whole cloves  
1 tsp ground nutmeg

**Directions:**  
Mix all ingredients in a large pan. Bring just to a boil. Strain.
