This recipe originally [came from Relish][1] and while it sounded good, I had to make a few adjustments since I don&#8217;t have a food processor. Here&#8217;s the description from the original article:

> Seasoning grilled meat with garlic and a sugary marinade produces a Thai-style barbecue that works well with pork loin or chops. Adapted from [_The Barbecue Bible_][2] by Steven Raichlen (Workman, 1998).

So, the changes I made&#8230;.one of the first instructions was to use the food processor on the garlic and sugar to form a paste. Well, I completely skipped this step. Instead, I put all the ingredients (minus the pork chops obviously) into a blender instead and just liquidized it. The garlic didn&#8217;t get mashed up as much as it would have in a food processor, but I also didn&#8217;t add as much garlic as they did either. We&#8217;re also giving this to our son, who&#8217;s only 18 months, so we didn&#8217;t want it too garlicky; but we still wanted the flavor, so I added about half of what is recommended.

I think we only marinated it for about 45 minutes and it still came out pretty good. I&#8217;m not a fan of pork, so I really didn&#8217;t have much, but the bite I did have was pretty good. I&#8217;ll let Jesse give an accounting for the taste, so check for his comment.

**Ingredients:**  
4 (1-inch thick) or 8 (1/2â€“inch thick) pork chops (2 pounds total)  
1 head garlic, broken into cloves and peeled  
3 tablespoons sugar  
1/3 cup soy sauce  
3 tablespoons honey  
3 tablespoons rice wine  
2 tablespoons dark sesame oil  
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger  
2 teaspoons salt  
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

 **Instructions:**

  1. Make 1 or 2 cuts in fat side of each chop to prevent curling.
  2. In a blender, combine garlic, sugar, soy sauce, honey, wine, sesame oil, ginger, salt and pepper. Spread over both sides of chops, place chops in baking dish, cover and marinate in refrigerator 1 to 2 hours.
  3. Preheat grill to high. Brush and oil grill grate. Place chops on grate and grill until brown 6 to 8 minutes per side for thick chops and half that time for thin, or until temperature on an instant-read thermometer is 160F. Serves
