For chrismtas this year, the MiL got me this fabulous bread pan (it has a lid!) and we&#8217;ve been making a lot of bread with it since.  Honestly, I think I&#8217;m giving up buying bread since it&#8217;s fairly easy to make my own.  Probably a lot cheaper to since we really don&#8217;t go through it that fast.  I can&#8217;t say that.  When it comes to homemade bread, we easily go through an entire loaf with a day or two &#8211; not so much with the store bought brands.

So we&#8217;ve been playing around with recipes and I am loving the recipe I found on [AllRecipes][1] for Amish White Bread.  It&#8217;s a little sweeter than a simply white, but it&#8217;s great as a base for most recipes.  So far we&#8217;ve tried mixing in chocolate chips as well as attempting a chocolate roll-style bread; while they&#8217;ve came out good, we can do better.  I&#8217;m thinking I might merge this recipe and my original [Chocolate Chip Bread][2] recipe and see if I can&#8217;t come up with a slightly better loaf.

As it stands, I&#8217;m really enjoying this recipe and already have a ton of variations in mind.  I&#8217;m thinking cinnamon chips need to be added to my shopping list for the next time I make this.

**Ingredients:**  
2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)  
2/3 cup white sugar  
1-1/2 tbsp active dry yeast  
1-1/2 tsp salt  
1/4 cup vegetable oil  
6 cups bread flour

**Directions:**

  1. Place all ingredients into the pan of the bread machine in the order suggested by the manufacturer. Select **dough** setting and press start.
  2. Remove dough from pan and place on floured surface.  Punch dough down. Knead for a few minutes, and divide in half. Shape into loaves, and place into two well oiled 9&#215;5 inch loaf pans. Allow to rise for 30 minutes, or until dough has risen 1 inch above pans.
  3. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes.
