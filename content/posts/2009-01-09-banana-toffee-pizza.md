This is another nice, quick and easy dessert recipe that I found via the Pampered Chef that went over really well – especially with guys. It&#8217;s a little bit on the rich side, but that just adds to it. My one recommendation would be to use the small mix n&#8217; scraper on the cream cheese instead of the stainless steel whisk. I ended up with more cream cheese in the whisk than any actually mixing. I trick I have learned since I first made this is to microwave the cream cheese first and then it&#8217;s easier to whisk it.

When I served this at a party, the ladies did come up with a really good variation on it. Instead of using the toffee and bananas, how does chocolate and strawberries sound? You would use chocolate crunch bars instead of the toffee bars; strawberries instead of bananas; hot fudge instead of caramel; and this last one is up to you, but I would play with using white sugar compared to brown sugar – I&#8217;m not sure which would be better.

One thing I do highly recommend is if you are using the Large Round Stone to make this, then you really need to have the Large Rack that goes with it. The Large Round Stone really doesn&#8217;t have any good way of grabbing it out of the oven, so the Large Rack would come in handy. _ETA: As of Spring 2009, the Large Round Stone is a discontinued piece, but they do still have a Round Stone with Handles that does come in Medium and Large._

**Ingredients:**  
1 package (18 ounces) refrigerated sugar cookie dough  
1 package (8ounces) cream cheese, softened  
1/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar  
1 container (8 ounces) frozen whipped topping (THAWED)  
4 bars chocolate covered toffee candy (Heath Bar)  
¼ cup toasted sliced almonds, coarsely chopped  
2 medium bananas, sliced  
¼ cup hot caramel ice cream topping

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Shape cookie dough into a ball and place in center of lightly floured Large Round Stone; flatten slightly. Using lightly floured Baker’s Roller, roll out dough to within 1 inch if edge. Bake 20-22 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from oven; cool 10 minutes. Carefully loosen cookie from baking stone using Utility Knife; cool completely.
  2. In Classic Batter Bowl, whisk cream cheese until smooth using stainless Steel Whisk. Add brown sugar, mix until well blended. Using Small Mix N’ Scraper, fold in whipped topping; spread evenly over cookie.
  3. Coarsely chop candy bars using Food Chopper. Immediately before serving, slice bananas using Egg Slicer Plus, arrange over filling. Sprinkle candy over pizza and sprinkle with almonds if desired.
