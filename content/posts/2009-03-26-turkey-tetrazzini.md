This recipe was given to me by Nikki and I wanted to share it&#8230;

> I made this yesterday and it&#8217;s already gone between dinner & lunch. Everybody in my fam loves it! I added a couple of cloves of minced garlic, extra cheese, and doubled the mushrooms b/c that&#8217;s how we role. It&#8217;s easy to make vegetarian as well.

**Ingredients:**  
1/2 lb. Spaghetti, broken into thirds, cooked and drained  
1-1/2 (10.75 oz) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup  
6 oz. shredded cheddar cheese  
3 cups cooked turkey (or chicken) breast  
1/2 lb. mushrooms, sauteed  
1 cup peas (thawed and drained if frozen)  
1 cup chicken broth

**Directions:**

  1. In a large saucepan, heat soup over low heat. Add 1 cup shredded cheese and stir together.
  2. Add turkey, mushrooms, peas, and cooked spaghetti to the soup mix and stir well.
  3. Add enough broth to make it &#8220;sloppy&#8221; and stir well.
  4. Spray 9&#215;13&#8243; pan and pour mix in. Top with remaining 1/2 cup cheese.
  5. Bake 30 minutes at 350 degrees &#8212; until bubbily on top.
