I haven&#8217;t tried these yet, but I had to add these to OSC when I found them.  These are totally thanks to [Bakerella][1] and I can&#8217;t believe I never even thought of trying something like this.  I love chocolate chip cookies and brownies, so why not put them together?  I&#8217;ll add more commentary once I actually try them (which will probably be this weekend &#8211; hell yeah!).   I mean, c&#8217;mon, brownies within a chocolate chip cookies&#8230;why am I still here, I could totally make these tomorrow.  Must get to store now!

**Ingredients:**  
1 package brownie mix  
1 cup butter, room temperature  
1 1/2 cups packed light brown sugar  
2 large eggs, plus 1 egg yolk  
1 tablespoon vanilla  
2 1/2 cups all purpose flour  
2 teaspoons baking powder  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
1/2 teaspoon baking soda  
12 oz. bag miniature semi-sweet chocolate chips

**Directions:**

  1. Make brownies according to package and let cool. Cut about ten 1 inch squares. Enjoy the remaining brownies. (I used a pan about 8 X 8)
  2. For the chocolate chip cookie dough, beat butter with a mixer until creamy. 
      * Add brown sugar and beat until smooth.
      * Add eggs, yolk and vanilla. Beat until smooth.
      * Combine flour, baking powder, soda and salt in a medium bowl and stir together with a wire whisk.
      * Add flour to butter mixture and beat until combined. Stir in mini chips.
      * Let dough chill covered in the refrigerator for at least an hour.
  3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  4. Use a measuring cup to scoop batter by the 1/2 cup. Since it’s chilled, you may need to pack it with a spoon. Then use the spoon to remove the dough from the cup and place it on parchment paper. Work quickly so the dough remains chilled or either prepare one cookie at a time so the rest of the dough remains cold.
  5. After the dough is on the parchment paper, make an indention and place a 1 inch square brownie in the center. Press the brownie down gently and work the remaining dough around the brownie. You can use your hands to shape the dough into a ball.  (_Note: During this step,_ [Bakerella][1] _found it easier to use a piece of parchment paper as a work surface since the dough can get sticky and then I used another piece of parchment paper for the baking sheet. If your dough gets too soft, you can chill the rolled dough balls for a few minutes right before baking._)
  6. Prepare six cookies at a time using a large baking sheet (15 X 20) and bake at 350 degrees for about 18 minutes. Return the remaining dough to the refrigerator until time to bake the second batch.
  7. Cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes and then cool completely on a wire rack.

**Notes:**  
[Mrs. Fields][2] has a version of these cookies as well, but their picture did not look as gorgeous as [Bakerella][1].  Although, she does offer one tip that I think will work for both of these recipes:

> Slightly undercook your brownies; they will continue baking inside the cookie. If you don’t have mini chocolate chips on hand (as I didn’t), simply chop up regular ones into smaller pieces. And finally, immediately give at least half of these cookies away. You won’t be able to trust yourself alone with more than a few of them. They will overpower you.
