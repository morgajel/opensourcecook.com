Over the last year, I&#8217;ve discovered [Tastefully Simple][1] and have been trying a couple of thier products.  Their [Bayou Bourbon][2] sauce is fantastic on meatballs and their [Absolutely Almond Pound][3] cake mix is one I could continuiously eat.  However, after awhile, pound cake does begin to loose its appeal &#8211; if it&#8217;s only pound cake.  So I started wondering what would happen if I threw some fruit into the batter.  Most desserts that involve pound cake have you put the fruit on top, so why not inside, right?  Seems like a logical experiment; one I have to say came out smashingly well.

More or less.  I haven&#8217;t included a picture here mainly because the bread pan that I did use, it isn&#8217;t the same size as a normal bread pan and the cake doesn&#8217;t look that great.  It&#8217;s definitely one of those delicious wrecks, but I&#8217;m going to attempt again before taking a picture of it.  That is one thing you need to make sure you do &#8211; do not overfill the pan.  I should have stuck with my initial gut feeling and split the batter between two pans, but I didn&#8217;t and I&#8217;m paying for it now.

I&#8217;m also thinking I have to cut back on the water because this came out really moist.  Granted, that isn&#8217;t a bad thing if you&#8217;re not planning on slicing it like a bread; but I would like to see it hold together a little better, so I&#8217;m cutting the water from 3/4 cup to 1/2 cup.  Remember, all of this is in regards to using peaches; I&#8217;m not sure if a different fruit wouldn&#8217;t have a varying result.  I&#8217;m thinking raspberries would really even less liquid, but blueberries would be fine with what is below.

**Ingredients:**  
1 box of Absolutely Almond Pound cake mix from [Tastefully Simple][1]  
3/4 cups (or 1.5 sticks) of melted butter  
1/2 cup water  
1/4 cup peach juice  
1 cup frozen sliced peaches, thawed and diced

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
  2. Drain the peaches, reserving about 1/4 cup juice, and dice the peaches into smaller pieces (or any size you would like).
  3. Combine all ingredients (except peaches) in a large bowl; blend well.  Do not over mix; batter will be lumpy.  Fold in peaches.
  4. Spread batter in a greased 9&#215;5 loaf pan.
  5. Bake for 50-55 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.  Cool completely; remove from pan and slice.
