This meal tends to be our fall back meal &#8211; very delicious!!!

Few Changes I typically make the recipe:  
I only add 1 tablespoon of hot sauce since I am not a huge fan of hot/spicy meals, however, the hubby will add extra to his portions on his own plate.  
Double all the ingredients for the sauce (brown sugar, honey, ginger, garlic, etc)  
We typically do not salt/pepper the strips since the soy has plenty of sodium already!

**Ingredients:**  
1 tbsp brown sugar  
2 tbsp honey  
1/4 cup soy sauce  
2 tsp chopped fresh ginger root  
2 tsp chopped garlic  
2 tbsp hot sauce  
salt and pepper to taste  
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves &#8211; cut into 1/2 inch strips  
1 tbsp vegetable oil

**Directions:**

  1. Mix together brown sugar, honey, soy sauce, ginger, garlic and hot sauce in a small bowl.
  2. Lightly salt and pepper the chicken strips.
  3. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken strips and brown on both sides, about 1 minute per side. Pour the sauce over the chicken. Simmer uncovered until the sauce thickens, 8 to 10 minutes.

**Makes:** 4 servings.
