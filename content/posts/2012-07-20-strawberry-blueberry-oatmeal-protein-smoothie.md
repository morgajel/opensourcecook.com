I&#8217;m attempting to lose the weight I&#8217;ve gained since high school and I&#8217;ve been experimenting with protein smoothie. I&#8217;m not a huge water drinker and drinking protein water&#8230;.not happening.  So smoothies it is. I&#8217;m a pinterest junkie and during one my recent forays into madness, I came across This Chicks Cooks&#8217; [Berry Banana Oatmeal Smoothie][1]. I&#8217;ve never thought about putting oatmeal into a smoothie before, but I do know that oatmeal is exceptionally healthy for you, so I was game to try it. It&#8217;s really tasty and I have a feeling I&#8217;ll be adding oatmeal.

However, while I was making it, I started thinking.  I like the antioxidants blueberries have and have been adding them to every smoothie I&#8217;ve been making. Plus I have protein mix that I&#8217;m suppose to be using as well, so I&#8217;ve kind of made my own smoothie based on [This Chick Cooks][2] recipe.

For my protein, I use [Body Fortress &#8211; Super Advanced Whey Protein][3], which is about 26g of protein per scoop. Depending on which type of protein powder you use, the calorie count I&#8217;m including may be a little different. In addition, I use store brand frozen fruit instead of fresh as it&#8217;s more convenient to have on hand. If you are using frozen fruit, I suggest crushing it up before adding the ingredients. It&#8217;ll make blending it all together easier. I also blended the fruit and oats separately before adding all the ingredients. I wanted to make sure everything was tiny enough for a smoother blend.

1/2 cup frozen strawberries  
1/2 cup frozen blueberries  
1/2 cup oatmeal  
2 scoops of whey protein powder  
1 banana  
1 cup milk  
1/2 tsp vanilla

**Directions:**  
If using frozen fruit, blend/crush up the fruit. Taking the fruit out, put the oats in the blender and let it run until they are ground up to as close of a powder as desired. Add the remaining ingredients and blend until smooth.
