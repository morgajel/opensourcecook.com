**Ingredients:**  
2 cups blueberries, chopped  
1 tblspn finely chopped jalapeno peppers  
1/3 cup chopped red onion  
1/4 cup chopped red and yellow bellpepper  
1 fresh lime, juiced  
Sea salt to taste  
Cilantro  
Pinch of cayenne pepper

**Directions:**  
Combine all ingredients into a bowl. Serve cold. Blueberries are a great source of age-defying antioxidants. And they taste sooo good! Note: You may substitute blueberries for ripe mangos, papayas, or even raspberries. For traditional salsa, use organic tomatoes instead of fruit.
