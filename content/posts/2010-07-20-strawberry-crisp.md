This is a recipe that stills needs a little work.Â  The strawberries come out a little too mushy for me, but I totally think it can be done.

**Ingredients:**  
4-6 cups quartered or sliced strawberries  
2/3 cups quick cooking oats  
1/2 cup sugar  
1/2 cup bisquick  
1/4 cup chocolate chips  
1/4 cup butter or margarine  
1 tsp cinnamon

**Directions:**

  1. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Mix together 1/4 cup sugar and strawberries. Spread strawberries mixture in ungreased square pan, 8x8x2 inches.
  2. Mix remaining ingredients until crumbly; sprinkle over strawberries.
  3. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until strawberries are tender and topping is golden brown. Serve warm.

**Variation:** Substitute sliced peeled all-purpose fruit for strawberries; substitute nuts for any kind of chocolate or toffee chips; substitute blueberries (or other fruit) for strawberries.

**Substitution for bisquick:** 1/2 cup bisquick = 1/2 cup flour + 1 tsp baking powder + dash of salt

**Ingredients for cake-size pan:**  
8 cups strawberries  
1-1/2 cup quick cooking oats  
1/4 cup brown sugar  
1 cup bisquick  
1/4 cup toffee bits  
1/2 cup butter or margarine  
1 tsp cinnamon
