The first thing I will say about this is you need to refrigerate the York peppermint patties at least 24 hours before making this. Cutting them up was a little interesting and they all stuck together so it made sprinkling them over the top a little difficult.

When I first made these brownies (before adding the York Peppermint patties), we found that the brownies were a little too fudgy so I doubled the flour amount.  Now that I had doubled the flour amount, the brownies came out a little too cake like.  So now I&#8217;m thinking that while I do need to increase the flour amount, I didn&#8217;t need to increase it as much as I did.  The original recipe had 3/4 cups, this time around I used 1-1/2 cups, so I&#8217;m thinking that 1 cup of flour will do the trick.

Another problem we came across was the york peppermint patties.  Sprinkling them on top and then baking the brownies really didn&#8217;t work all that well.  It worked, but the patties ended up getting hard and they were&#8217;nt really that chewy.  So next time, I&#8217;m planning on mixing the patties straight into the batter and baking that way.  If that doesn&#8217;t work, then I&#8217;m going to take a step from the [Rocky Road Brownies][2] and sprinkle them on top and then bake them for 3-5 mintues after the brownies have had a chance to bake.  I may make these again this week to see if this works, but I&#8217;m not sure yet.
