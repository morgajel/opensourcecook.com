Ian had a blast cutting out the shapes and watching us frost them.

There is one thing I did change. The nutmeg in the recipe just seemed to be a little too strong for me. When I took a bite of the cookies (before frosting), I really didn&#8217;t get any sugar out of it. So I&#8217;m going to try and cut out the nutmeg next time.

It&#8217;s rather easy to make the frosting for the sugar cookies. All you have to do is mix 1 cup powdered sugar with 1/2 tsp vanilla and just enough milk to make it creamy. Super easy and you can actually make the frosting into a glaze if you wanted. Just add a lot of milk to make it really thin. You can also add food coloring to give it a fun look.

2 cups sugar  
1 cup shortening  
2 eggs  
1 cup buttermilk  
1/2 tsp soda  
1 tsp baking powder  
1 tsp vanilla  
1 tsp nutmeg (optional)  
1/2 tsp salt  
4 cups flour (for drop cookies) or 4-1/2 cups for rolling

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
  2. Mix all ingredients, leaving the flour for last, until thoroughly mixed.
  3. Either roll out the dough and cut out shapes or place rounded spoonfuls of dough onto a cookie sheet and bake for 10 minutes, just until set but not brown.
