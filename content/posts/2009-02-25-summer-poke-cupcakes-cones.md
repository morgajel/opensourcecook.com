For the base cupcake recipe, I found this fun one by Jell-O called [_Summer Fun Poke Cupcakes_][2], which I added to the [_Kooky Cupcake_][3] recipe from Keeber.

One thing I will say, one cake mix will be more than plenty for 24 cones.  I was thinking of doing this recipe times two (one with wild strawberry gelatin and one with grape), but I won&#8217;t have to with the amount of batter I&#8217;ll have.  I could&#8217;ve filled the cones a little bit more (which I&#8217;ll know for next time), but I still had enough batter left over (after 24 cones) to do a small cake for us to have Thursday night after dinner.   This part, I do have to say, I like.  After all, I&#8217;m killing two birds with one stone this way &#8211; treats for the kiddies in the morning and the birthday cake for dinner all in one swoop.  If you&#8217;re looking to use up most of the batter, then I would guess that it&#8217;s okay to fill the cones up 3/4 of the way instead of the 1/2 way that is recommended in the directions.

There is one thing that I would like to try, but since this was my first time baking in ice cream cones, I didn&#8217;t want to chance it not working.  According to the [_Kooky Cupcake_][3], it says to place the cones into a muffin pan, but I&#8217;m wondering if I couldn&#8217;t just put the cones into a cake pan and call it good.  With a muffin pan, I can only bake 12 at a time, but I was able to find all 24 cones in my cake pan when I was setting things up.

For being my first time baking in ice cream cones, I think they came out pretty well.  Adding in the hot gelatin was a good too, but I did have leftovers of this as well.  Since originally, I&#8217;m suppose to add 1 cup cold water along with the 1 cup boiling water (which you don&#8217;t do for the cupcakes), I still went ahead and added the cold water (basically doubling what was there) and had Jell-o for Ian the next day.

**Ingredients:**  
1 pkg white cake mix  
1-1/4 cups water  
1-1/3 vegetable oil  
3 egg whites  
1 cup boiling water  
1 pkg. (4-serving size) JELL-O Gelatin, any red flavor  
1 tub (8 oz.) COOL WHIP Whipped Topping, thawed  
24 ice cream cones

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  2. Prepare batter as directed.  Wrap foil around cone base and place straight up in ungreased muffin pan.  Fill cones with 1/4 cup of cake batter (approximately 1/2 full). Do not over fill the cane or it may bake over the sides. Let batter settle before placing cones in oven.
  3. Place partially-filled cones in oven and bake 25-30 minutes at 350°F.  Cool in pans 10 min. Pierce tops with fork.
  4. Stir boiling water into dry gelatin mix until dissolved; spoon over cupcakes. Refrigerate 30 min. Remove from pans.
  5. Spread whipped topping over cupcakes. Add decorations as desired. Store in refrigerator.
