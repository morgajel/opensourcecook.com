For one thing, I didn&#8217;t use a skillet.  I don&#8217;t have one that will fit 4 burgers and you can easily make more than that (I had 4 burgers and 2 micro burgers for Ian).  Instead, I used my electric griddle, which still worked fine, but I didn&#8217;t get what I needed for the gravy.

So I did have to make my own gravy at the end, but I still used all the ingredients I was suppose to (I just didn&#8217;t have any leavings from the skillet).  The gravy still came out good, so it&#8217;s not essential to use the leavings.  I do have to say, though, I think I found a great tool to use when making gravy.  It&#8217;s the [mini-whipper][2].  It made stirring the gravy so much easier than using a regular whisk.  When I first got the [mini-whipper][2], I really didn&#8217;t think I would use it (I mainly got it for my kit), but after tonight, I&#8217;ll be using it a lot more.

The other thing I like about this recipe is the use of the flour and buttermilk before using the crackers as coating &#8211; it made cooking the meat so much easier.  I didn&#8217;t have the crumbs falling off on the griddle or sticking to anything but my fingers.  It was great.  Normally, when I use breadcrumbs (or anything), some of the coating comes off when I use a spatula to flip the burgers/chicken and that didn&#8217;t happen this time.  I&#8217;ll be using this technicque again for sure.

Not only will I use that technique, but I think you could easily mix this recipe up.  Instead of using chipotle pepper, try a spicier pepper or a milder one.  I did mix one thing up &#8211; I used whole wheat saltines instead of the regular ones.  This added more fiber to the recipe and it still tasted great.

Honestly, I like this recipe.  It wasn&#8217;t too spicy for me; the meat was still juicy inside; and I think I can play with it.  That&#8217;s a home run for me.  So if you&#8217;re looking for something different to do with hamburger, try this one.

**Ingredients:**  
[<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3465/3277940768_2f3e9b4dc3_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180" />][3]1 tbsp + 1 tsp chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, divided  
1 lb 80% lean ground beef  
1-1/2 cups finely crushed saltine crackers (about 37 or one tube)  
1-1/2 cups buttermilk  
1 egg  
1/2 tsp salt  
1/4 tsp ground black pepper  
1/2 cup all-purpose flour  
3 tbsp vegetable oil  
3/4 cup beef broth

**Directions:**

  1. Finely chop chipotle pepper using food chopper.  In batter bowl, combine 1 tsp of the chipotle pepper, beef, 1/2 cup of the crackers, 1/4 cup of the buttermilk, egg, salt, and black pepper; mix well.  Shape beef mixture into four irregular-shaped patties, about 1/2 inch thick.  Place flour in first coating tray.  Pour 3/4 cup of the buttermilk in second tray and place remaining 1 cup of the cracker crumbs in third tray.  Lightly dredge each patty in flour, shaking off excess; dip into buttermilk and then into crackers, pressing gently to secure crumbs to patty.
  2. Add oil to skillet; heat over medium heat 1-3 minutes or until shimmering.  Place patties in skillet; cook 4-6 minutes on each side or until internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F and patties are no longer pink in center.  Remove patties from skillet to paper towel-lined plate (do not wipe out skillet).
  3. Add 2 tbsp of the flour from coating tray to skillet; whisk using flat whisk until smooth.  Gradually add broth and remaining 1 tbsp chipotle pepper, whisking until smooth. Cook 1-3 minutes or until gravy comes to a boil, whisking constantly.  Whisk in remaining 1/2 cup buttermilk.  Cook 1-3 minutes or until thickened, whisking constantly.  Serve gravy over steaks
