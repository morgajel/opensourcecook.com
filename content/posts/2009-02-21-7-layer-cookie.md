This is another recipe my Grandma Smith used to make quite a bit since it is really simple and deliciously sinful.

**Ingredients:**  
1/2 cup butter  
1 cup crushed graham crackers  
1 (8oz) pkg coconut  
1 (8oz) pkg chocolate chips  
1 (8oz) pkg butterscotch chips  
1 cup chopped nuts  
1 can sweetened milk

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  2. Melt the butter in a 9&#215;13 pan. Spread one layer of ingredients on top of another as they are listed. (Spread graham crackers in pan, then put coconut on top, then chocolate chips, etc.)
  3. Pour milk over top then with a spoon or one deft hand, pat the mixture down.
  4. Bake for 25 minutes. Cool before cutting.

**Variation:** Using 16oz of any chips. I.e. 1/4 butterscotch chips, 1/4 white chocolate chips, 1/4 chocolate chips, and 1/4 peanut butter chips OR 1/3 white chocolate chips, 1/3 chocolate chips and 1/3 peanut butter chips.
