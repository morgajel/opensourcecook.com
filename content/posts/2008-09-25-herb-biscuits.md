When Jesse and a bunch of his colleagues had to work the late shift for the yearly turnover, Chicken and Dumplings were requested and I took them in for the guys that night.  After making the dumplings in the slow-cooker, I felt like there wasn&#8217;t a lot of dumplings and everyone loves dumplings.  So I made these biscuits as a backup and they seemed to go over really well.  I didn&#8217;t make them the traditional size, but instead I used the smallest cookie cutter I had so they were more munchable.  I wanted it to be easy for someone to pop them into their mouth or add it to the stew without having to cut them up.  They turned out really well and Jesse said they were like crack for everyone at work.  Even those who had gone out to eat had kept coming back to grab one or two more.

The recipe is really easy for anyone who knows how to make biscuits using Bisquick.  It&#8217;s basically the Bisquick recipe with a few spices added in.

**Ingredients:**__  
2-1/4 cups Bisquick  
1/4 tsp dried basil leaves  
1/4 tsp dried rosemary  
1/8 tsp dried tarragon  
2/3 cup milk

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 450 F degrees.
  2. Combine Bisquick mix and herbs in small bowl. Stir in milk to form soft dough.
  3. Place on surface generously sprinkled with bisquick mix and knead until desired consistency (honestly, I knead it until it stops sticking to me).
  4. Roll out dough and cut out circular shapes (using a cookie cutter) and place cutouts on ungreased baking sheet.
  5. Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until golden brown.

**Variations:**  
For drop biscuits, do not knead dough.  Drop by spoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheet.

_Cheese-Garlic Biscuits_: Make drop biscuits, except decrease bisquick mix to 2 cups and add 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese.  Mix 2 tbsp butter or margarine, melted, and 1/8 tsp garlic powder; brush over warm biscuits.
