Doesn&#8217;t this sound good already?  I&#8217;m not usually a fan of &#8220;tres leches&#8221;, but when I received this from the Pampered Chef, there was something about it that made my taste buds water.

Now I will say this, while I wouldn&#8217;t call them exotic, there are definitely some ingredients that take some hunting for this trifle.

  1. Ladyfingers: I&#8217;ve never seen a ladyfinger before.  I&#8217;ve never needed them, so I wasn&#8217;t exactly sure where to look in the store.  After asking four different associates, walking up and down three different aisles and not finding anything that even remotely resembled what Jesse knew of ladyfingers, I ended up not using them.  Instead, I was able to substitute pound cake for the ladyfingers and I think it works.  I&#8217;m not sure what the taste difference would have been, so if anyone does try it with the ladyfingers, I would like to know.
  2. Coconut Milk:  The idea isn&#8217;t new, it makes sense after all, but trying to find it &#8211; that&#8217;s something I haven&#8217;t done before.  It is actually pretty easy to find, it&#8217;s right next to the condensed milk, but they don&#8217;t sell it like the condensed milk.  Instead, you&#8217;ll be looking for a 32oz carton.  Which means, since you only need 14oz, you&#8217;ll have some left over. Gives you a reason to make this again, doesn&#8217;t it?

Other than those two ingredients, everything is pretty easy to find.  If you have the Korintje Cinnamon from the Pampered Chef, I would definitely recommend using that, but whatever kind of cinnamon you have on hand works just as well.  Also, as you can tell by the picture, I didn&#8217;t pipe the cool whip on top.  It may change up the presentation a little, but I find spreading it across the top works just as well.  The one change I have made to the recipe is I doubled the strawberries.  In the words of Jesse, _it&#8217;s good for not being chocolate_, but I felt like it needed more.  The strawberry taste definitely works against the pudding mixture (in a good way) and I totally wanted more.  So the original recipe calls for one pound, but personally, I would go with two.

Other than that, Jesse is taking this into work tomorrow, so we&#8217;ll see what his co-workers have to say.

2 lbs fresh strawberries, divided

  3. Reserve 1 cup of the whipped topping as a topping. Combine pudding mix and remaining coconut milk in a mixing bowl; whisk until thickened. Add remaining condensed milk and cinnamon; whisk until incorporated. Fold in remaining whipped topping.

**Cook&#8217;s Tip:** Ladyfingers are sheets of sponge cake that can be separated into long ovals and are found in the bakery section of most grocery stores.

One 16-oz (about 390-g) frozen pound cake, thawed, trimmed and diced into 1-in. (2.5-cm) cubes, can be substituted for the ladyfingers, if desired.
