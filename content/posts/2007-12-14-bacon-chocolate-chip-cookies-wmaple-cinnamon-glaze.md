Now don&#8217;t go knockin &#8217;em just yet. Have you tried them? Are you sure they are not good? Jesse handed me this recipe after going on and on about how great bacon is and how it tastes great with everything. Well, I was skeptical about this recipe, but I&#8217;ve made it and it&#8217;s not that bad.

The original recipe came from the blog [Ooh you tasty little things&#8230;][1]. She [Muffin] goes into more detail than I will, but she&#8217;s had a really great response to this recipe. I will admit, it&#8217;s strange biting into a chocolate chip cookie and tasting bacon, but it&#8217;s not horrendous. In fact, the bacon isn&#8217;t really that powerful. You get enough of a taste of something salty, but mix that with the chocolate and it really works. Yes, it&#8217;s strange and odd. But there are a ton of things that are strange and odd that are not so after you try them. It&#8217;s worth the experimentation.

**Bacon Chocolate Chip Cookies**  
1 cup butter  
2/3 cup packed brown sugar  
2/3 cup granulated sugar  
1 tsp almond extract  
1/2 tsp vanilla extract  
2 egg  
2-1/2 cups flour  
1 tsp baking soda  
1/2 tsp salt  
2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips  
2 cups bacon, cooked and chopped into pieces (about 2lbs)

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
  2. Beat together the butter, sugars, flavoring and eggs until creamy. In another bowl, sift together the dry ingredients. Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture and stir together. Dough will be slightly soft. If you want a cakier cookie, add another half cup of flour. Add in chocolate chips and bacon bits. Stir until well integrated. Place dough on a sheet of waxed paper and refrigerate at least an hour. Remove dough from fridge, pinch off 1 1/2 inch pieces of dough and roll into balls. Set dough balls about 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. Flatten dough balls <span style="font-style: italic">slightly</span> with your fingers in the center.
  3. Bake cookies for about 10 minutes, or until the dough starts to turn golden brown. Allow cookies to cool on a cooling rack while you ready the glaze.

**Maple Cinnamon Glaze:**  
2 cups powdered sugar  
1 tbsp maple extract  
1 tsp vanilla extract  
1 tsp cinnamon  
3 tbsp water to make a thick glaze

**Directions**:

  1. Mix all ingredients together until smooth and creamy. If lumpy, use a whisk.
  2. Spread a small amount of the glaze on the top of each cookie and top with a small piece of crisp cooked bacon.

**Notes:** It has been suggested that using 1 full cup of butter (instead of the original 3/4 cup) works best due to cookie dough dryness)

It has been suggested that the almond flavoring may be overpowering to the flavor of the cookie, feel free to add this ingredient to taste*

It has been suggested that using 2 eggs (instead of 1) works best due to cookie dough dryness

If preferred, you can separate the dough into two parts and only make half of the dough into bacon cookies, in which case you&#8217;ll only want to use 1 cup bacon bits.

Also, you can make your own bacon bits, just make sure you pat down the bacon chunks with paper towels to remove as much extra bacon grease as possible. Someone made their own bacon bits and found out that apparently it takes about 2lbs of bacon to make 2 cups of bacon bits, just for future reference.**
