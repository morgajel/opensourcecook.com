I did make a few changes to the recipe.  Not really because I felt the need to, but because it was what I had on hand.  First off, the recipe uses bone-in and skin-on chicken.  Neither of us are a fan of that and we have the frozen in the chicken in the freezer, so we didn&#8217;t use that.  Because of this, the chicken isn&#8217;t going to take a full hour to cook.  I initially put the chicken in for 35 minutes and then I&#8217;ll see if it needs to go longer.  Something I do with my chicken, that&#8217;ll make a difference, is I cut each breast in half.  So even though I only thawed 2 breasts, by cutting them in half, I have 4 thinner breasts.  It&#8217;s a little easier to cook since there isn&#8217;t so much chicken to heat and it actually saves money since we really don&#8217;t eat more than that and it&#8217;s enough for the 2.5 of us.

The other change I already mentioned is the lack of veggies.  I didn&#8217;t have any of them on hand (I need to go shopping), so the chicken is cooking without them.  I&#8217;m feeling like this will also cut back on the baking time, but the next time I make this, I&#8217;ll make sure to have the veggies so I&#8217;ll know for sure.

For the garlic, I added more than four.  Since garlic is so good for something trying to reduce their cholesterol, and since Jesse is trying to reduce his, I tend to add extra garlic.  I was also finishing up the clove, so all of the garlic were small pieces, so I want to say that I added 6 or 7 pieces.  At the moment, it is smelling really garlicky and Jesse is loving it.

The last changes I made involve the lemon.  I didn&#8217;t have any fresh on hand, but I did have lemon peel and lemon juice so I used those instead.  For the zest, according to the [Ingredient Substitution][2] chart, for 1-2 tsp of fresh lemon zest, you can substitute 1 tsp lemon peel, so that&#8217;s what I did.  The lemon juice is pretty much equivalent since they mention in the directions that they want 2 tbsp of juice, however, 1 lemon will generally give you about 3 tbsp of juice.

So those were my changes.  I&#8217;ll be back after dinner to update this and hopefully provide a picture.

_After Dinner:_ Yeah, remember to follow the lemon measurements closely.  You can NOT add more lemon if you can&#8217;t smell it over the garlic, it is definitely there, so don&#8217;t worry.  I made that mistake tonight.  Since I added the additional garlic, and I couldn&#8217;t smell the lemon, I added a little more peel and juice and that was so not the thing to do.  It smelled really good, so I&#8217;m thinking if the lemon hadn&#8217;t been overpowering, it would have been really good.

We did find out that rice and the new Ginger-Wasabi sauce is really good together.

**Ingredients:**  
3 lemons divided  
1/4 cup olive oil  
4 garlic cloves, pressed  
1 tbsp dried oregano leaves  
1/4 tsp salt  
1/2 tsp black pepper  
4 bone-in, skin on chicken breasts or boneless, skinless chicken  
8 petite red potatoes  
1 medium red bell pepper  
1 medium red onion  
8 oz white mushrooms

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Using a zester, zest two of the lemons to measure 1-1/2 tbsp zest. Juice one of the zested lemons using a juicer (or I actually use a stainless wire whisk) to measure 2 tbsp juice. In a bowl, combine zest, juice, oil, pressed garlic, oregano, salt and black pepper; mix well. Place chicken on center of a large bar pan (aka stoneware). Using a basting brush, brush the chicken with about 2 tbsp of the lemon juice mixture.
  2. Cut potatoes in half. Cut bell pepper into 1-in strips. Cut onion into 1-in wedges. Thinly slice remaining lemon using a mandoline fitted with v-shaped blade. Combine potatoes, bell pepper, onion, lemon slices and mushrooms with remaining lemon juice mixture in mixing bowl; toss to coat.
  3. Arrange vegetables around chicken on pan. Bake 1 hour or until the chicken registers 180 degrees F in thickest part of breast (with a thermometer), brushing chicken and vegetables with pan juices after 30 minutes.
