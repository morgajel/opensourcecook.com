Seriously, this is probably my all time favorite product so far. Yes, the garlic press is great (and they just announced it&#8217;s been redesigned), but nothing beats the [Scoops][1]. There are three different sizes &#8211; Small/1 tbsp, Medium/2 tbsp, and Large/3 tbsp &#8211; and I have been enjoying the Medium/2 tbsp [Scoop][1] so much. I&#8217;ve been making a ton of cookies and this thing has been making it a breeze.

Tonight when Jesse requested No-Bake Cookies at 10pm, my biggest concern was the time it takes to spoon out the cookies. I usually have no problem making these since they are a quick and easy recipe, but spooning the cookies onto wax paper is time consuming; however, tonight, I was able to get these out in record time. The Medium/2 tbsp [Scoop][1] not only allowed me to do this quickly, but it was a lot cleaner as well. When you use two different spoons to make No-Bake cookies, there always seems to be drippage from the pan to the table, but I didn&#8217;t have that problem this time. I only had to use the one Medium/2 tbsp [Scoop][1] and since it has an enclosed area, there wasn&#8217;t anything on the wax paper except the cookies I was laying out. It was awesome.

Now the only thing Jesse remarked on was that he would have liked it if I had used the Small/1 tbsp [Scoop][1] instead of the Medium/2 tbsp [Scoop][1] simply because of the size of the cookies. The Medium/2 tbsp Scoop is great for chocolate chip or oatmeal cookies, but Jesse likes smaller No-Bake cookies so he can enjoy them longer. So it&#8217;s all a matter of preference, but seriously, for anyone who makes a lot of cookies, this is the perfect tool to have in your kitchen. I&#8217;m already planning on getting the other two [Scoops][1].
