This is another Pampered Chef recipe that I am trying to perfect since I have to demo it this weekend.  Normally, I try and stick to stupid easy recipes to do during the cooking show, but since this one was given to me 5 days in advance, I can&#8217;t really change something that has been agreed upon.  I will be honest (as I always am), I tried a different variation of this awhile ago and I wasn&#8217;t a fan of it.  So when I made it this time, I planned ahead of time to made some changes.

The first change I made was changed the amount of dill used.  The original recipe calls for 2 tsp of the Pampered Chef&#8217;s Pantry Dill Mix, but that was really over powering for us (although his co-workers said it was great cold, so maybe it&#8217;s only overpowering when its warm).  I also changed the salt content from 1/4 tsp to just a dash since Jesse is having an issue with his cholesterol right now.

The first time, I also did it as a braid and I want to say it came out looking a lot better as a ring.  You can also do it as a wreath which looks a little like the braid, but looks a lot easier to do.  I&#8217;ll include the directions for the braid and a wreath at the bottom.

As I starting thinking about writing this recipe up, I realized that I had sent it in with Jesse without one of the ingredients.  There is suppose to be a cup of shredded cheddar cheese with the mixture, but it didn&#8217;t look odd without it.  This is giving me the idea that this recipe could easily be changed to meet someone&#8217;s needs.  For instance, this could totally be done as a vegetarian.  Take out the meet and add a couple more veggies &#8211; i.e. carrots, celery, onions, green peppers, etc.  You could also probably change out the chicken for tuna or beef.  This would also be a great way to do an egg casserole for those early morning get togethers.

From what I&#8217;ve been hearing from Jesse&#8217;s co-workers, it sounds like this came out really well.  But, I don&#8217;t want to put words into anyone&#8217;s mouths, so I&#8217;ll wait and see if anyone says anything.

_Updated 12/10/10: I did make this recipe again and I did a few things different.  You can read about it [here][1]._

**Ingredients:**  
2 pkg (8oz) refrigerated crescent rolls  
2 cups coarsely chopped cooked chicken  
1-1/2 cups coarsely chopped broccoli  
1/2 cup diced bell pepper  
1/3 cup mayonnaise  
1 tsp Dill mix or dried dill weed  
dash tsp salt  
1 garlic clove, pressed  
1 egg white, lightly beaten  
1/4 cup slivered almonds

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In **Classic Batter Bowl**, combine chicken, broccoli, cheese, bell pepper, mayonnaise, seasoning mix, salt and garlic; mix well.
  2. Unroll crescent rolls and separate into 16 triangles.  Arrange triangles, slightly overlapping, in a circle on a **Large Round Stone** with wide ends 4 inches from the edge of baking stone.  Points will extend off the edge of the baking stone.  Roll wide ends of dough toward center to create a 5-inch opening.
  3. Using the **Large Scoop**, scoop filling evenly over dough in a continuous circle.  Bring points of triangles up over filling and tuck under dough at center to form a ring &#8211; the filling will show.  Brush with egg white.  Sprinkle with almonds.  Bake 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.

**Variation:**  
 _The Wreath_

  1. Unroll 2 packages of refrigerated crescent rolls; separate into 16 triangles.  Arrange eight triangles in a circle on a large round stone with wide ends 3 inches from edge of baking stone and points towards the outside.  Points will extend off the edge of the baking stone.  Arrange remaining triangles in center of baking stone, matching wide ends with triangles already in place.  Points will overlap in the center.
  2. Using the baker&#8217;s roller, roll over seams of triangles where wide ends meet, creating a smooth surface for filling.  Do not seal center triangles.  Using a large scoop, scoop filling evenly over dough in a continuous circle.
  3. Beginning with the last triangle placed in center of the baking stone, bring point of triangle straight across filling.  Next bring point of opposite outside triangle diagonally across filling, covering point of previous triangle.  Filling will show.  Repeat, overlapping points of inside and outside triangles to form a wreath.  Tuck the last end under the first.

_The Braid_

  1. Unroll 2 packages refrigerated crescent rolls; do not separate.  Arrange dough on a rectable stone with longest sides of rectangles across width of baking stone.  Roll dough to seal seams.
  2. Starting on the longest sides of the baking stone, cut sides of dough into eight strips, about 1-1/2 inches wide and 3 inches long.  Using a large scoop, scoop filling evenly over center of dough.
  3. Starting at one end, lift one strip of dough; twist one turn and lay across top of filling.  Repeat, alternating strips of dough to form a braid.  Fold bottom edges of dough up at ends of braid.
