This recipes comes from Don Wablstrom, in the [_Essential Game Bird Recipes_][1] by Pheasants Forever, and he mentions this in the cookbook:

> Prepare this with any pheasant that is on hand &#8211; breast, thighs or pieces. If using breasts, tenderize them with a mallet to an even thickness.

I can tell you one thing I will definitely be changing is the cream of mushroom soup. Jesse and I do not like mushrooms (I think Ian does though), so we never use the cream of mushroom and can usually substitute cream of celery or cream of chicken.Â  However, for pheasant, I&#8217;m thinking I&#8217;ll use the cream of chicken since it was also used in the Baked Swiss Pheasant Breasts recipe.

**Ingredients:**  
enough pheasant for 6 people  
1/2 cup Italian-style bread crumbs  
1 green or red pepper  
1 can (10-3/4 oz) cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic  
8 oz sour cream  
1 cup grated cheddar cheese

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat moist pheasant with bread crumbs. Place in a lightly oiled covered dish. Bake for 30 minutes.
  2. Meanwhile, blend pepper, soup and sour cream at high speed in an electric blender. After 30 minutes, pour sauce over pheasants. Bake for another 15 minutes. Sprinkle with grated cheese immediately upon removal from oven.

**Yield:** 6
