This is a recipe a friend forward me and it completely takes in the spirit of this site.  William is still experimenting with this recipe, so don&#8217;t hesitate to adjust any of the ingredients or directions.  If you find something that works well, let us know.

The one thing William did tell me is that the point of putting the salsa in the beans (other than for flavor) is to make them a little more spreadable on the chips.  The cheese layers are there to form a barrier between the meat, beans and salsa.  He also recommends using the medium salsa because the mild will end up tasting more like tomato soup than actual salsa.

**Ingredients:**  
2 lbs ground beef  
2 (16oz) cans refried beans  
2 8 oz cans of black olives, diced  
1 small jar pepper rings (pick your favorite poison)  
taco seasoning  
1 bag round tortilla chips  
2 bags shredded mexican-style cheese  
large (64 oz, say) jar of salsa

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 400 F
  2. Spread a layer of chips on the bottom of a 9&#215;13 baking dish, enough to cover the bottom to a layer of 2-3 chips deep (but not too deep, it&#8217;s going to be a bottom crust&#8230;).
  3. Mix 1-1/2 cups of salsa and refried beans in a bowl.  Microwave bowl long enough to heat beans and spread bean mixture on chips, add a layer of shredded cheese, and heat in oven long enough to melt cheese.
  4. Cook ground beef, drain, and add 1/4 cup of taco seasoning and just enough water to make it not dry (say 1/2 cup)
  5. Remove pan from oven, add ground beef, and another layer of cheese; heat in oven again to melt cheese.
  6. Remove pan from oven, add a layer of salsa, black olives, and pepper rings; top with more cheese (mmm, mm, good), and heat until melty. Serve&#8230;may require a spoon; holds its shape better the next day
