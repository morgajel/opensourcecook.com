When my cousin got married, she had asked me to do a sugar-free cake for her reception.  Since it was for a wedding reception, I wanted to do something special so I thought I would attempt a Lemon Meringue style of cake.  The cake did come out good, but this recipe definitely needs some work.  The cake itself was a little dry, so something needs to be adjusted there.

The other thing I&#8217;m not happy with is the meringue part.  Using it as a frosting just didn&#8217;t work.  Well, it does work, but since the meringue part does need to bake, you have to bake it on whatever you want to display it on.  I don&#8217;t know about anyone else, but my baking sheets are really not that special. While, I do love using my stoneware and will use that before reaching for a metal sheet, my is getting to be in really good shape.  Meaning it&#8217;s turning all shorts of shades of brown and black (remember, the darker the stone, but the better).  So while I could&#8217;ve displayed the cake at the reception on my stone pan, I didn&#8217;t want to.  So what I&#8217;m thinking is add the meringue as part of the filling or as another layer.  Then once the cake comes out, adding a layer of whipped cream to the top.  Of course, I would clean up the edges, maybe trimming off a little so it was pretty and square, but that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking.

As for the fact that it&#8217;s sugar-free, I did use a straight 1:1 ration sugar substitute, so anyone _should_ be able to use regular sugar and make this totally decadent.  If anyone does take a stab at this and end up with something good, let me know.

**Ingredients:**  
 _Cake:_  
4-1/2 cups all-purpose flour  
2 tsp baking powder  
1-1/2 tsp baking soda  
1/2 tsp salt  
1-1/3 cup butter or margarine  
3-1/2 cups sugar substitute  
4 eggs  
2 tsp vanilla

_Lemon Filling_:  
2 cups sugar substitute  
1/2 cups cornstarch  
2 cups water  
4 egg yolks, slightly beaten  
1/4 cups butter  
2 tsp grated lemon  
2/3 cups lemon juice  
2 drops yellow food coloring (optional)

**Directions:**

  1. _Make the Lemon Filling 12-24 hours in advance_: Mix sugar and cornstarch in saucepan. Gradually stir in water, and cook over medium heat stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and boils.  Boil and stir 1 minute, gradually stirring in the egg yolks. Stir and boil 2 minutes.  Remove from heat, stir in butter, lemon peel, lemon juice and food coloring (optional). Refrigerate until next day. Save the egg whites for the meringue.
  2. _Make the Cake_: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and lightly flour two 9×1-1/2 inch round baking or one 13x9x2 baking pan; set pan(s) aside. Stir together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside.
  3. In a large mixing bowl, beat the the butter or margarine with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds. Add sugar; beta til well combined. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Beat in vanilla. Add dry mixture and 1-1/4 cups _water_ alternately to beaten mixture, beating on low speed after each addition just until combined. Pour batter into the prepared pan(s).
  4. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until a wooden toothpick comes out clean. Cool layer cakes in pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Remove layer cakes from pans. Cool thoroughly on racks.
  5. _Assemble Cake_: Spread the meringue around the outside of the cake and dots some on the top of the cake.  Preheat oven to 350°F and return cake to oven; bake until the meringue is golden brown.
