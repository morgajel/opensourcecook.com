The base recipe is pretty much the same one I used for Ian&#8217;s first birthday cake (the [Oreo Dark Chocolate][2]), so there&#8217;s a few things to keep in mind:

  1. I know most cakes tend to be moist, but do **_NOT_** get the super moist cake mixes. They tend to be a little to pliable and will break apart when you try to manhandle them out of the pan and whatnot.
  2. Make sure you get the whipped frosting for the sides.  Otherwise the frosting will end up pooled at the base and very thin at the top.

I am using two different frostings for this recipe. I don&#8217;t normally do that, but how can you have a German Chocolate cake without the Coconut Pecan frosting?  You can&#8217;t, but that particular frosting doesn&#8217;t like to stick well, hence the reason for the second kind.  Also, make sure you allow the cake to cool at least 2 hours, if not longer, before trying to level it off.  If it&#8217;s not completely cooled, there&#8217;s a better possibility of cutting off more or making the cut uneven.  As for the pudding mixture, the longer it sits, the better it is to work with.  I usually make the filling the night before so it&#8217;s good and set.  The whip cream will keep it creamy and still make it pretty firm, which is fabulous when trying to spread frosting on it.

Believe it or not, making these layered cakes is really easy.  Since I started doing them 2 years ago, I&#8217;ve come to really rely on [10&#8243; Cake Leveler][3] and [Cake Lifter][4].  Seriously, trimming the top off the first layer is a lot easier with the leveler than using a wire.  Plus,the lifter may seem frivolous, but it&#8217;s a lot sturdy than using my hands.

_Added 7/23/10:_ One complaint I had was that the texture of the filling really didn&#8217;t go with the idea of German Chocolate.  The pecans weren&#8217;t chopped enough and it was more creamy.  So I added 7oz of coconut to the filling and I think this will do it.

1 pkg of German Chocolate cake mix + ingredients to make  
1 pkg of whipped chocolate frosting  
1 pkg of coconut pecan frosting  
1 pkg of Jell-O Coconut Cream pudding mix  
1 cup of cool whip  
1-1/2 cups milk  
7oz coconut  
1/4 to 1/2 cup finely diced pecans

**Directions:**

  1. Combine milk and pudding mix in medium bowl. Beat with wire whisk 2 minutes or until well blended. Stir in 1 cup semi-thawed cool whip and pecans. Refrigerate at least 2 hours or until set.
  2. Prepare and bake cake according to box directions. Cool completely.
  3. Take one cake and level the top off, making it flat. Add the coconut to the chilled pudding mixture. Layer pudding mixture lavishly onto cake. Once completed, gently add the second cake on top of mousse.
  4. Use the whipped chocolate to frost sides of the cake.  Use the coconut pecan to frost the top of the cake, letting it drip over the edge a little.  Viola.
