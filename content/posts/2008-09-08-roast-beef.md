This is one of those recipes I made up as I went.  I&#8217;ve been playing with pot roast recipes for awhile and it always depends on what I have in the kitchen at the time.  That&#8217;s actually one of the reasons I like playing with this recipe.  The only thing you really have to worry about is making sure you have a roast to add to the slow cooker.  Normally, I usually add potatoes, but since we didn&#8217;t have any then they didn&#8217;t get included.  I did end up going out and buying some red potatoes, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to add them to the roast.  I&#8217;ll figure something else out for them.  However, I did have a green pepper and onions this time, so I threw some of those in.  Plus Jesse and I did something we have fun with, we played with a few new spices.  We have the ground savory and tarragon on the shelf, but I can&#8217;t really remember why I got it in the first place, well, now we&#8217;re trying it in the pot roast and after having it cook for 4-5 hours, it&#8217;s smelling really good.

**Ingredients:**  
About 2 lbs of a roast  
Carrots to taste  
Celery to taste  
Green peppers to taste  
Onions to taste  
2 Bay leaves  
Salt to taste  
Pepper to taste  
Onion powder to taste (optional)  
Garlic powder to taste (optional)  
1/2 cup of water  
Dash of tarragon  
Dash of ground savory

**Directions:**  
In a bowl, mix together the chopped up potatoes, celery and carrots. Place in the bottom of the slow cooker. Place pot roast on top of vegetables. Sprinkle spices on top of pot roast and veggies. Pour water over roast and vegetables. Cook for 8 to 10 hours.
