This is actually the mousse filling I used for the [Chocolate Raspberry Cake][1], but it is also amazing on its own.

**Ingredients:**  
24 oz frozen raspberries  
1/4 cup sugar  
1 tablespoon unflavored gelatin  
1 tablespoon lemon juice  
28oz whipped cream

**Directions:**

  1. <span class="bodytext">In a saucepan combine 12 oz of raspberries and sugar. Heat and stir over medium heat until the mixture turn to liquid. Stir in gelatin and lemon juice. Remove from heat and scrape into a large bowl. Let cool for 5 minutes.<br /> </span>
  2. <span class="bodytext">Remove chilled whipped cream from refrigerator. Mix 1 cup of whipped cream into raspberry mixture until well combined. Fold in remaining whipped cream. Refrigerate mousse overnight.</span>
