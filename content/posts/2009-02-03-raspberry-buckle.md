I&#8217;ll be honest, this is one recipe I haven&#8217;t tried in awhile. The original recipe is for the classic blueberry buckle, but I wanted to try it with raspberries instead. The crumble topping isn&#8217;t very crumbly when you&#8217;re making it.  It&#8217;s more of a wet doughy texture.  It still works as a crumble, you just can&#8217;t &#8220;sprinkle&#8221; it.

**Ingredients:**  
2 cups all-purpose flour  
2-1/2 tsp baking powder  
1/4 tsp salt  
1/2 cup shortening  
1/4 cup egg product (or 1 egg)  
1/2 cup milk  
2 cups raspberries (fresh or frozen)  
1/2 cup all-purpose flour  
1/2 cup sugar  
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon  
1/4 cup butter or margarine

**Directions:**

  1. Grease bottom and 1/2 inch up sides of a 9x9x2-inch baking pan; set aside. In a medium bowl combine the 2 cups flour, baking powder, and salt; set aside.
  2. In a medium mixing bowl beat shortening with an electric mixer on medium speed for 30 seconds. Add the 3/4 cup sugar. Beat on medium to high speed until light and fluffy. Add egg; beat well. Add flour mixture and milk to beaten egg mixture, beating until smooth.
  3. Spoon batter into prepared pan. Sprinkle with blueberries. In another bowl combine the 1/2 cup flour, the 1/2 cup sugar, and cinnamon. Using a pastry blender, cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; sprinkle over blueberries. Bake in a 350 degree F oven for 55 minutes or until golden. Serve warm.

**Variation:** Blueberry Buckle: Prepare as above, except substitute fresh or frozen blueberries for the raspberries.  I&#8217;m pretty sure you could do this recipe with any kind of fruit you want.
