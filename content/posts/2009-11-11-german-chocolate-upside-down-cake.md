This is a recipe my friend Rachel sent me and it sounds really yummy. I may have to make this relative soon.  I&#8217;m adding this recipe exactly as she sent it to me, but I&#8217;m thinking that before cutting the cake and inverting each piece individually, it might be a little easier to flip the cake all at once.  However, I haven&#8217;t made it yet, so I&#8217;m not entirely sure how that would turn out.

**Ingredients:**  
1 cup flaked sweetened coconut  
1 cup chopped pecans  
1 package (18.25 ounces) German chocolate cake mix  
eggs, water, and oil as directed on package  
8 ounces cream cheese, room temperature  
1/2 cup butter or margarine, room temperature  
1 pound confectioners&#8217; sugar, about 3 3/4 cups, unsifted

**Directions:**

  1. Grease and flour a 9x13x2-inch baking pan. Heat oven to 350°.
  2. Sprinkle coconut and pecans evenly over the bottom of the prepared pan. Prepare cake mix with the appropriate measurements of water, oil, and eggs, following the package directions. Pour the cake batter over the coconut and pecans. Beat together the cream cheese, butter and confectioners&#8217; sugar; drop by spoonfuls over the top of cake batter. Bake for about 45 to 50 minutes. A toothpick should come out clean when inserted into the center of the cake portion.
  3. Cool the cake in the pan on a rack. To serve, cut into individual serving-size pieces and, using a spatula or cake server, remove from the pan and turn upside-down on dessert plates.
