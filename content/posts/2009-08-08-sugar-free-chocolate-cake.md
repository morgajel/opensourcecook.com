My mother is a diabetic, so for her 50th birthday party, I wanted to have a chocolate cake for her. Ideally, it was going to be a chocolate cake with strawberry mousse, but after tasting the chocolate cake, I didn&#8217;t want to try strawberries just yet. Quite honestly, I haven&#8217;t had time to play with this yet, so she&#8217;s getting my first attempt.  Well, I my second attempt since I didn&#8217;t like my first attempt enough to let it slide and decided to take the time to rebake it even though I was running out of time.

The first time I made this, I forgot I had unsweetened baking chocolate in the cupboards and tried using regular semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Yeah, don&#8217;t do that.  Well, the batter wasn&#8217;t bad with this, it just had more of a peanut butter-chocolaty feel more than straight chocolate.  I also made the mistake of not looking too closely at the directions and I doubled the recipe since I was going to use two 9inch round baking pans.  Don&#8217;t do that either.  Doubling the recipe was a bad idea because I ended up with way more batter than I needed, which was the real reason I scrapped the first cake.  Upon baking, the cake overflowed (but didn&#8217;t destroy) and it was a little too moist for my likening.  Think quicksand moist.  On top of the peanut butter-chocolaty favor, I wasn&#8217;t too happy with it.

So I decided to redo it and I have to say that was a great idea. This was about the time I remembered I had the unsweetened chocolate and that made a world of difference.  I originally thought that there was too much butter in the recipe, but I forgot that the chocolate chips added some of that favor as well.  Plus, the unsweetened bars gave the cake more of a chocolate look than the chips did.

This recipe is really just the Chocolate Cake recipe from my Better Home & Garden&#8217;s New Cookbook, but instead of using the sugar, I substituted it with Splenda.  I also didn&#8217;t use as much the second time around since I ended up being a little under 1/4 cups than I needed, so I didn&#8217;t worry about it.  It&#8217;s for a diabetic, oh no I didn&#8217;t use all the sugar.  We&#8217;ll see if I&#8217;ll need to retract that later.

My original idea for the cake included a strawberry mousse, but I&#8217;m running out of time and my recipe is just too complicated for that (I was planning on using the Raspberry Mousse recipe, substituting strawberries for raspberries, but next time).  However, I&#8217;ve been thinking about this so what I am going to do is get either a cream cheese or cheesecake or vanilla pudding mixture, do the mousse like I normally do, but add in some sliced strawberries.  It may not be a strawberries mousse, but at least it&#8217;ll have some strawberries in there.  I&#8217;m going to use frozen strawberries since that&#8217;s what I have, but I&#8217;m sure fresh would work just as well.  Plus, with the frozen ones, after they&#8217;ve thawed out a bit, they&#8217;ll be a little mushy so they&#8217;ll blend better with the mousse.  At least I hope so.
