Jesse wanted French fries tonight, so we looked up a couple different recipes and came up with our own. It&#8217;s not that hard once we figured out what the basics were and they came out pretty well.

The first attempt at making these, we baked them at 400 degrees F. This did not work. They fries came out mushy and not that great. Most recipes called to cut the potatoes into wedges, but that&#8217;s not what we wanted, so we cut them into cubed strips.

**Ingredients**  
3 russet potatoes  
2 tbsp olive oil  
1 tsp Cajun seasoning  
1 tsp onion powder  
1 tsp garlic powder

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
  2. Cut potato into wedges. Mix olive oil, paprika, garlic powder, chili powder and onion powder together. Coat potatoes with oil/spice mixture and place on a baking sheet.
  3. Bake for 45 minutes in preheated oven.
