This is good news and bad news. The good news: I can make brownies whenever I want. I always have these ingredients on hand at home (well, minus the marshmallows and nuts). The bad news: I can make brownies whenever I want.

Since I found the recipe, I decided to make some rocky road brownies. Jesse had been going on and on about rocky road brownies, ice cream, etc all day, so I figured why not. I did make a few changes to the recipe. For instance, I doubled the amount of chocolate chips that were melted because it just didn&#8217;t seem like enough to me. However, since I doubled the chocolate, I didn&#8217;t mess with the flour and this caused it to be a little more fudgy in the middle than what I had intended. So I doubled the amount of flour as well. The fudgy center wasn&#8217;t really a bad thing, but it did change the texture a little. Regardless of this, the brownies came out really good. They were so good, that the majority of them were gone before I could get a picture of them. So this is what you get.

The one thing I will caution you about this recipe is the chocolate chips and marshmallows on top.  Too many chocolate chips is actually a bad thing for this recipe because it&#8217;ll drown out the marshmallows.  So don&#8217;t go nuts adding the chips.  Jesse doesn&#8217;t think the chips on top were needed at all, so use your own judgment on this.

**Ingredients**:  
1/2 cup butter or margarine  
3/4 cup chocolate chips  
2 eggs  
1 cup sugar  
1 tsp vanilla  
1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour  
1/2 cup chopped nuts  
1/2 marshmallows

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  2. Grease an 8&#215;8 baking pan; set aside. In a medium saucepan melt butter and 1/2 cup chocolate chips over low heat. Remove from heat. Stir in eggs, sugar, and vanilla. Using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, beat lightly just till combined. Stir in flour and nuts.
  3. Spread batter in prepared baking pan. Bake in oven for 30 minutes.
  4. Immediately sprinkle 1/4 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cup marshmallows evenly over brownies. Bake an additional 3 minutes or until marshmallows are just beginning to brown and chocolate is melted.
