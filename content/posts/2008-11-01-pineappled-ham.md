So what do you do when you have a slab of ham in the refrigerator? Throw something together.  At least, that&#8217;s what I did with mine.  I know brown sugar and pineapple go well with it, so this is what I came up with.

It&#8217;s very basic and you might even have all the ingredients in your pantry without realizing it.

**Ingredients:**  
1 &#8211; 1.75lb ham  
1 &#8211; 20oz can of crushed pineapple (with juice)  
4 tbsp of brown sugar

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  2. In a separate dish, mix together the pineapple and brown sugar.
  3. Score the bottom of the ham with a knife and place inside a roasting pan.  Cut a cross into the top of the ham and fill with the pineapple sugar mix. Using a knife, force as much of the mixture into the cuts onto of the ham.  Pour the remaining mixture over and around the ham.
  4. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 30-45 minutes (usually about 15 minutes per pound).
