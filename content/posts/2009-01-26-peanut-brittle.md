This is a recipe I picked up from [Better Homes & Garden][1].  Putting butter on the cookie sheets worked like a miracle.  The peanut brittle came off so easily that it came off as one piece&#8230;lifted right out.  I also have to say, for not measuring the baking soda, just sprinkling it over the mixture, it still came out beautiful.  This is definitely a keeper.

<img decoding="async" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right;" src="http://images.meredith.com/bhg/images/recipe/l_10043.jpg" alt="" /> **Ingredients:**  
2 cups sugar  
1 cup light corn syrup  
1/2 cup water  
1/4 cup butter or margarine (no substitutes)  
2-1/2 cups peanuts  
1-1/2 tsp baking soda

**Directions:**

  1. Butter 2 large baking sheets; set aside. Butter sides of a heavy 3-quart saucepan. In pan combine sugar, corn syrup, water, and butter. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until mixture boils. Clip a candy thermometer to side of pan. Reduce heat to medium-low; continue boiling at a moderate, steady rate, stirring occasionally, until the thermometer registers 275 degrees F, soft-crack stage (about 30 minutes). Stir in nuts; continue cooking over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until thermometer registers 295 degrees F, hard crack stage (15 to 20 minutes more).
  2. Remove pan from heat; remove thermometer. Quickly sprinkle baking soda over mixture, stirring constantly. Immediately pour onto prepared baking sheets. Use 2 forks to lift and pull candy as it cools. Cool completely; break into pieces. Store tightly covered up to 1 month.
