A couple of weeks ago, we tried the Inside-Out Lasagna recipe from the Pampered Chef [_Stoneware Inspirations_][1] cookbook and it was a hit.  I love lasagna and this made it really easy to make.  Not only was it easy, but it&#8217;s totally a recipe that could be made in advance and then baked later on.

We only had two issues with this one.  The first being the pasta.  The bow tie was nice, but at times it was kind of hard to cut through the layer of pasta on the bottom.  The second time I made this, I used rotini pasta instead and I think it&#8217;s going to work out a little better.  I haven&#8217;t cut into it yet since it&#8217;s currently sitting in my freezer, waiting for a night where I need something to throw into the oven.

I&#8217;ll be honest, I love cheese and it seemed like there was a lot of ricotta cheese, but once you bite into it, that&#8217;s not really the case.  There&#8217;s a really good balance and I generally add more cheese to recipes because there&#8217;s never enough &#8211; I have no intention of adding more this time around.  Well, I might add a little Parmesan once it gets to the table, but that&#8217;s it.

Overall, this is a great recipe and super easy to make.

**Ingredients:**  
1pkg (12oz) uncooked bow tie pasta  
1/2 medium onion, chopped  
1.25 lbs lean ground beef or Italian sausage links, casings removed

4 eggs  
1 container (32oz) part-skim ricotta cheese  
2 cups (8oz) shredded mozzarella cheese  
1/2 cup (2oz) grated fresh Parmesan cheese  
2 tbsp snipped fresh parsley or 1 tsp dried parsley  
1/2 tsp salt  
1/2 tsp black pepper

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cook pasta according to package directions.
