This recipe tends to be a little dry, but I&#8217;m not sure what could be added to moisten it up. Otherwise, it&#8217;s really good. This is probably the one bread machine recipe we make all the time.

**Ingredients:**  
1 cup milk  
3 tbsp water  
4 tsp honey (or sugar)  
1 tbsp butter or margarine  
1-1/2 cups wheat flour  
1-1/2 cups bread flour  
3/4 tsp salt  
1 tsp active dry yeast

**Directions:**  
Place all ingredients into the pan of the bread machine in the order suggested by the manufacturer. Select wheat or basic setting, select either light or medium crust and press start.
