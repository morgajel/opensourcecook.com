Jesse likes a lot of dumplings, so my dumpling recipe is twice what normal recipes call for. He also likes a lot of gravy, so it may seem like the liquid is disproportionate with the chicken and veggies. All of this is correct.

This actually turned out a lot better than I thought it would. We did have a slight problem when I used our 2 quart pan. It was a tight fit. Next time, we are definitely going to have to use something bigger. I&#8217;m thinking I need a 3 quart pan.

Overall, it was good. I did end up making more biscuits, since I thought Jesse would end up eating all of the dumplings on me. I did add a twist on the biscuits. I added oregano and parsley to the bisquick dough so it would have the same taste as the dumplings. I&#8217;m hoping this doesn&#8217;t make the difference is dough types to obvious. Jesse ended up saving me some dumplings, so I haven&#8217;t had a chance to try this out yet.

**Ingredients:**  
3-4 Chicken, breasts &#8211; skinless boneless  
Carrots  
Onions  
Celery  
Potatoes  
1-1/2 cups Water  
1-1/2 cups Chicken broth (or 1-14oz can)  
1 tsp dried Basil  
Salt  
Pepper, black  
1 Bay leaf  
2 cups Flour, all-purpose  
4 tsp Baking powder  
1/2 tsp Salt  
1/2 tsp Oregano  
1/2 cup Egg product or 2 beaten  
2 tsp Parsley  
1/2 cup Milk  
4 tbsp Vegetable oil  
1 cup Water, cold  
1/2 cup Flour, all-purpose

**Directions:**

  1. Rinse chicken. In a large pot (bigger than 2 quarts) combine chicken, the 2 cups water, onion, potatoes, basil, salt, pepper, and bay leaf. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 25 minutes. Add celery and carrots. Return mixture to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer about 10 minutes more or till chicken and vegetables are tender. Discard bay leaf.
  2. For dumplings, in a mixing bowl, combine the 1 cup flour, parsley, baking powder, 1/4 tsp salt, and oregano. In another bowl, combine the egg, milk, and oil; add to flour mixture. Stir with a fork until moistened. Drop batter onton the hot chicken in broth. Do not drop batter into the liquid. Return to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 10 to 12 minutes or until a wooden toothpick inserted into dumplings comes out clean. Do not lift cover while simmering. Transfer chicken, dumplings, and vegetables to a serving platter; keep warm.
  3. For gravy, pour broth into a large measureing cup. Combine the 1/2 cup cold water and 1/4 cup flour; stir into the broth. Add salt and pepper to taste. Cook and stir until mixture is thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 1 minute more. Serve gravy over chicken and vegetables with dumplings.
