This recipe has been a favorite of the hubby’s and mine for awhile now. However, the recipe originally calls for a 4 pound chicken – we usually just use 3 or 4 chicken breasts.

**Ingredients:**  
1 clove crushed garlic  
1/4 pound butter, melted  
1 cup dried bread crumbs  
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley  
1 teaspoon salt  
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper  
1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  2. In a shallow glass dish or bowl, combine the crushed garlic with the melted butter or margarine. In another small bowl mix together the bread crumbs, cheese, parsley, salt and pepper. Dip chicken pieces into garlic butter, then into crumb mixture to coat.
  3. Place coated chicken pieces into a lightly greased 9&#215;13 inch baking dish. Drizzle with remaining garlic butter and bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.

**Makes**: 6 servings
