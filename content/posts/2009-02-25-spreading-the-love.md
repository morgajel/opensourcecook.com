Just thought I would point everyone to [this snazzy article][1] I found about OSC.  The site, [Cooperation][2], appears to be about promoting anything and everything Open Source related and I&#8217;m thrilled that they spotlighted us on their site.  It&#8217;s always a good feeling when I find someone out there who gets what I&#8217;m actually trying to do.
