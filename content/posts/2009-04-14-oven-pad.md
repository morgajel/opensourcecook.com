[<img decoding="async" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right;" src="https://www.pamperedchef.com/graphics/products_250/1346_v.jpg" alt="" />][1]I have found an [oven pad][1] that I am loving.  I am not a fan of the oven mitts or the glove looking things.  I always feel like they are more in the way than letting me do what I need to do.  However, I just got the one Pampered Chef sells and this thing is awesome. This thing rocks.  My first impression when I opened it up was &#8220;damn this thing is huge&#8221;, but that&#8217;s the beautiful part.  It may be huge, but on the back of the it is a place to slide in your hand and it fits to your hand like a baseball glove.  You don&#8217;t have to concentrate on holding the pad and it&#8217;s really easy to grab any dishes out of the oven.

In all honestly, I will admit, it is kind of hard to explain the benefits of this pad without actually seeing it, so make sure you ask about it at the next show you go to. If you&#8217;re looking to replace your current oven pads, I would highly recommend getting a couple of these. I&#8217;ve already ordered my second one and am seriously thinking about getting another set.
