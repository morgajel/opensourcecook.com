[<img decoding="async" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right;" src="http://brands.kraftfoods.com/coolwhip/Images/cwlogo.jpg" alt="" />][1]I had completely forgotten about this recipe book I picked up at the grocery store. All it has are recipes made from Jell-O and Cool Whip. A lot of them look really easy, but would make a great presentation. The type of presentation that will make you look like an excellent cook.

So I went to [the Cool Whip site][1] to see what else they had and I found a lot of [great recipes][2]. Including some that were sugar free and low fat.  The other thing I like about this site already &#8211; they don&#8217;t have pictures of the recipes&#8230;they have videos.  Not only is there a video showing you how to go about preparing it, but it shows you different angles of the recipe.  That is worth so much more to me than the picture.

A perfect example of this is the recipe for [Low-Fat Raspberry Summer Sensation][3].  The video makes it look like its really easy to make, but did you see how it comes out?  Beautiful.  This is a recipe I&#8217;m going to have to try soon and I bet you can easily switch this up with orange sorbet with oranges or even peach sorbet with peaches!

**Ingredients:**  
1 pt. (2 cups) raspberry sorbet, softened  
1 pkg. (1.5 oz.) JELL-O Vanilla Flavor Fat Free Sugar Free Instant Pudding  
1 cup cold fat-free milk  
1 tub (8 oz.) COOL WHIP Sugar Free Whipped Topping, thawed  
1 cup raspberries

**Directions:**

  1. LINE 9&#215;5-inch loaf pan with foil. Spoon sorbet into prepared pan; freeze 10 min.
  2. BEAT pudding mix and milk with whisk 2 min. Stir in COOL WHIP; spread over sorbet.
  3. FREEZE 3 hours or until firm. Unmold onto plate; remove foil. Let stand 10 min. to soften slightly before slicing to serve. Top with berries.

**Tips:** _How to Soften Sorbet_: Soften sorbet in microwave on MEDIUM (50%) for 10 to 15 sec. or until slightly softened.

**Substitutions:** Prepare using raspberry sherbet. Prepare using COOL WHIP FREE Whipped Topping.
