I never thought to make a streusel tart before, but then I found this recipe from the Pampered Chef and thought I would give it a try. It ended up being really easy to make except I think I added a little too much berry filling when I first made it. The tart was a little too heavy and the bottom center never really cooked thoroughly. I also changed up the filling a bit so I wasn&#8217;t exactly following the directions. Instead of using cherry pie filling and fresh strawberries, I used strawberry pie filling and fresh raspberry and blueberries. The flavor was good, but I think I added too many berries. So this is one that can definitely be fiddled with, in regards to the fruit center, but definitely keep an eye on how much of the fresh fruit you add.

**Ingredients:**  
1 pkg (15oz) refrigerated pie crusts, softened as directed on  
package  
1/2 cup pecans halves, divided  
2 tbsp sugar  
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon  
1 cup strawberries, hulled and sliced  
1 can (21oz) cherry pie filling

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly sprinkle the [stoneware][1] with flour. Gently unfold one pie crust and place in center of [baking stone][1]; roll to within 1 inch of edge of stone using lightly floured [baker&#8217;s roller][2]. Using [cheese grater][3], grate 1/4 cup of the pecans evenly over crust to within 1-1/2 inches of edge.
  2. For streusel, coarsely chop remaining pecans using [food chopper][4]. In a [batter bowl][5], combine pecans, sugar and cinnamon; mix well. Cut remaining pie crust into 1/2-inch pieces using Crinkle Cutter (it is not necessary to unfold crust); add to pecan mixture and mix well.
  3. Hull strawberries using [cook&#8217;s corer][6]. Slice strawberries using an [egg slicer][7]; arrange in a single layer over grated nuts on pie crust. Spoon pie filling over strawberries; sprinkle with streusel. Fold outer edge of pastry up over filling to form a 1-1/2 inch rim. Bake 30-35 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Remove from oven; cool slightly. Serve warm.
