When I first came across the [Handy Scraper][1], I wasn&#8217;t too impressed with it. It&#8217;s a flat piece of plastic for $6. However, I ended up getting one and I&#8217;m loving it.

I&#8217;m one of those cooks who dices with a knife and then picks up the pieces with said knife to transfer the items to the bowl. This method has always worked for me, but I always had to do it multiple times in order to get everything off the cutting board. I can&#8217;t remember when I initially came across the [Handy Scraper][1], but I remember thinking at the time &#8220;it&#8217;s not worth it to me for $6&#8221;. My attitude has so changed. I mean, not only did it take a few trips with the knife to get everything over to the cutting board, but I couldn&#8217;t load up the knife because I was always afraid of cutting myself. With the [Handy Scraper][1], I don&#8217;t have that fear anymore. Plus, I can get everything in one scoop and it actually slides along the cutting board easier.

This is what really sold it for me. Running the [Handy Scraper][1] across the cutting board and not having really any friction, so it was one smooth operation. Have you tried doing that with a knife?
