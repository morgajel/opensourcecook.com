Bananas and chocolate just seem to go so well in my head, and after making Ian&#8217;s cake, I didn&#8217;t see why I couldn&#8217;t do the same thing with Bananas. So here is a variation on the [Dark Chocolate Oreo Cake][1].

**Ingredients:**  
2 packages of Dark Chocolate cake mix  
3 packages of whipped chocolate frosting  
2 packages of Jell-O banana pudding mix  
2 cups of cool whip  
3 cups milk  
bananas (optional)

**Directions:**

  1. Combine 3 cups cold milk and 2 packages of banana pudding mix in medium bowl. Beat with wire whisk 2 minutes or until well blended. Stir in 2 cups thawed cool whip. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or until set.
  2. Prepare and bake both cakes according to box directions. Cool completely.
  3. Take one cake and level the top off, making it flat. Layer banana mousse lavishly onto cake. Once completed, gently add the second cake on top of mousse.
  4. Frost all sides of the cake.
