I can&#8217;t remember if this recipe was given to us or if I found it on his website, but this courtesy of Dev_null, a friend of Jesse&#8217;s from #asp. This makes so much chili that I made it once for four and there was so much left over, we were still eating it a week later. This is one of those recipes where you make it for a pot luck or whenever you&#8217;re trying to feed a bunch of people. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, this chili is great, but it makes a LOT.

So why am I posting about chili during the beginning of summer? Well, Jesse was thinking about it the other day and he showed the recipe to some of his co-workers and the next thing I knew, it was being requested. The only problem is, neither Jesse or I drink beer. Well, I used to (and on some occasions will take a sip or two), so I have no idea what kind to use. Plus, what beer I did drink was imported and I&#8217;m not sure if Corona would taste all that great with it (I learned how to drink in Mexico, give me a break). When I made it before, I used chicken broth which was fine. However, I&#8217;m going to leave it up to the people who are going to be eating it. Do I use beer or chicken broth? If I use beer, what kind do I use? The plan is to make this in two weeks, so people have two weeks to give their input.Â  There is a poll in the sidebar, so go cast your vote.Â  I&#8217;ll be back in two weeks to give commentary on the recipe while I make it.

**Ingredients:**  
3/4 of a lb of bacon  
1 lb of chicken breasts
