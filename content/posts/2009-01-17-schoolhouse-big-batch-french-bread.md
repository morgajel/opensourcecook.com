3-1/2 cups bread flour  
3 pinches of yeast  
2 cups cold water  
7 cups bread flour  
2 tbsp and 1-1/4 tsp yeast  
2-1/4 cups cold water  
2 tbsp and 1-1/4 tsp salt

**Directions:**

  1. Start the night before and mix up 3-1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 3 pinches of yeast, and 2 cups cold water in a very large bowl (i used the 8qt. Pampered Chef bowl &#8211; perfect size!). Use a strong spoon and mix until it comes together in a shaggy lump. Good enough. Cover well with plastic wrap and leave it in a cool place in the kitchen overnight.
  2. In the morning, mix in:7 cups all-purpose flour, 2 tbsp and 1-1/4 tsp yeast, and 2-1/4 cups cold water. Stir this in with that sturdy spoon until it&#8217;s pretty mixed. Don&#8217;t mind the scraps stuck to the edges of the bowl. Let rest for 20 minutes.
  3. Take it out onto a clean work surface, unfloured, and sprinkle with 2 tbsp and 1-1/4 tsp salt. Start kneading the dough, and knead until it&#8217;s smooth and supple and doesn&#8217;t feel lumpy, dry, or too sticky. It will undergo textural changes&#8211;start looking for a feeling of finish around the eight minute mark.
  4. Change to a new, clean bowl that&#8217;s been sprayed with Pam, and is also large, or wash out your first one and spray it. Plop the dough in, spray some plastic wrap with Pam, and cover nicely. Leave it to rise for 45 minutes. Note that all risings are done in a COOL PLACE.
  5. Lightly flour your clean counter and turn the dough out. Very gently fold it over on itself, then turn it over and do it again. It will be so stylishly floury. Replace in bowl and let rise for 75 minutes.
  6. Gently remove again onto the floured surface and cut it into halves with a sharp knife. Cut each half into quarters. Take each of the eight sections and very lightly shape into a ball. Leave on the counter all parked together, and loosely draped over with the plastic wrap. Let rest for 20 minutes.
  7. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper (or sprinkle with cornmeal). Shape each dough section into a baguette, trying not to deflate too much. Lay four loaves on each pan, cut diagonal slashes in the top of each loaf with a sharp knife, cover lightly with plastic wrap, still oiled, and let rise for 40 minutes.
  8. At last, preheat the oven to 450. Slide the pans in and bake for about 25 minutes.

**Note:** The loaves freeze good. To use a frozen loaf, thaw 1 minute in the microwave, then heat in a 350 oven for about 8 minutes.
