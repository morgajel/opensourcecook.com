So far, I&#8217;ve found a couple that I like: Baked Swiss Pheasant Breasts and Baked Pheasant in Creamy Sauce.  I&#8217;m going to be making my first pheasant dish tomorrow and it&#8217;s going to be one of these two, but I&#8217;m not sure which one yet.

If anyone has cooked pheasant before, any tips you have would be awesome.
