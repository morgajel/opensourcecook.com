The idea of replacing the devil&#8217;s food cake with the angel food cake seemed simple enough when I wanted to do something with white chocolate.  The cake came out well enough, however, I have made some slight adjustments to the original recipe due to the new ingredients.

I ended up taking out the eggs because I&#8217;m pretty sure these were only included because the devil&#8217;s food cake required the eggs and since the angel food cake didn&#8217;t, they went away.

I also changed the amount of strawberry jam used simple because the cake ended up being more of a strawberry cake than a white chocolate cake.  You really couldn&#8217;t taste the white chocolate with all the strawberry.  The one thing I will concede is that I originally wanted to take the strawberry completely out of the cake mixture, but Jesse thinks it should stay in at a reduced amount.  So still using the strawberry glaze, you could exclude the strawberry in the cake mixture completely if you wanted to.

I also doubled the amount of white chocolate chips in the cake mixture.  Since I haven&#8217;t made it with this adjustment, I&#8217;m not sure if that means I also have to double the amount of oil as well.  I&#8217;m going to be making this for sure next month, so I&#8217;ll let you know then if keeping the oil at the original amount makes any difference or if I needed to double it.

Overall, the cake came out well with this variation.  The one thing that I did notice is that I can&#8217;t make angel food cake.  At least not on the first try.  My deflated a little more than I think it was suppose to, but this was my first crack at it, so I&#8217;m not surprised it didn&#8217;t come out perfect.  The cake is going in to work with Jesse tomorrow, so we&#8217;ll see what his co-workers say (if anything).

As with the [Chocolate Velvet Cake][2], the fresh strawberries are completely a garnish. So, since the chocolate is different, you want to change up the fruit, then go for it.  Just make sure you change it up throughout the entire recipe.

**Ingredients:**  
_Cake_  
1/4 cup plus 1 tbsp vegetable oil, divided  
1 cup white chocolate morsels  
1 pkg (18.25oz) angel food cake mix  
3/4 cup water  
1 jar (12oz) seedless strawberry jam, divided

_Glaze and Garnish_  
1/3 cup melted vanilla ice cream  
1 cup white chocolate morsels  
1 qt fresh strawberries, divided  
Additional ice cream (optional)

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  2. Brush [fluted pan][3] with 1 tbsp of the oil using a [basting brush][4]. For cake, combine chocolate morsels and oil in [small batter bowl][5]. Microwave on HIGH 30-60 seconds or until melted and smooth, whisking after 30 seconds. In 4qt) [mixing bowl][6], combine cake mix, water, 1/4 cup of the jam and chocolate mixture; whisk until well blended. Pour batter into pan.
  3. Place pan in oven and bake for 30 minutes or cake is a golden color and cracks are dry to the touch.  Wipe rim of pan clean using paper towel, if necessary. Center a [large round platter][7] over pan and carefully invert. Without removing pan, let stand 10 minutes. Remove pan.
  4. For glaze, combine ice cream and chocolate morsels in [small micro-cooker][8]. Microwave on HIGH 20-60 seconds, stirring after each 20-second interval, until melted and smooth.
  5. To finish cake, place remaining jam into [a prep bowl][9] and microwave on HIGH 30 seconds or until melted; brush evenly over cake. Holding by stems, dip 16 of the strawberries into glaze; arrange around bottom edge of cake. Drizzle top of cake with remaining glaze. Slice remaining strawberries using [egg slicer][10]; place into center well of cake. Serve with additional ice cream, if desired.

**Cook&#8217;s Tip:** For an optional cooking method (and if you have a fluted stoneware pan), you can microwave the cake on HIGH for 9-12 minutes or until wooden pick inserted near center comes out clean. For best results, bake this cake in a 1000-watt microwave with a built-in turntable.
