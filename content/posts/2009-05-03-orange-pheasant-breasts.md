This recipes comes from the [_Essential Game Bird Recipes_][1] by Pheasants Forever.  I&#8217;m not sure who contributed it to the cookbook, but that&#8217;s where I found it.

Jesse is always looking for an orange recipe and this one sounds tempting.  I may have to try this with chicken, if I don&#8217;t try it with pheasant first.

**Ingredients:**  
2 skinless pheasant breast fillets  
2 tbsp butter  
4 tsp flour  
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon  
1/2 cup orange juice (1 orange freshly squeezed)  
2 tbsp orange marmalade  
3/4 tsp chicken bouillon cube or paste  
1 tbsp orange liqueur (_optional_)  
1/2 cup green seedless grapes  
2 oranges, peeled and sectioned  
1/4 cup sliced or slivered almonds, toasted

**Directions:**

  1. Heat oven to 325 degrees F.
  2. Line an 8x8x2-inch baking pan with heavy-duty aluminum foil, leaving a 1-1/2 inch foil flap or cllar sticking out on all sides. Place pheasant fillets in a single layer in pan.
  3. Melt butter in a suacepan. Stir in flour and cinnamon until smooth. Blend in orange juice, marmalade and bouillon. Bring to a boil, stirring until thickened. Stir in the liqueur. Spoon the sauce over pheasant.
  4. Tear off a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil 11 inches long. Cover the baking pan with this piece, pressing foil down on top of pheasant (leave a little extra room for heat expansion). Work around the pan, folding top sheet together with collar from lower sheet to make a tight seal.
  5. Bake for 30 minutes or until meat is tender. Remove top sheet, spoon grapes and orange sections over pheasant and bake, uncovered, for another 5 minutes, or until fruit is heated through. Garnish with almonds and serve over hot rice, if desired.
