This is actually a recipe from my grandmother that my mom seems to love, yet I&#8217;m not sure what I think about it. While we were doing the holiday baking this weekend, we added this to our list when we realized we had all the ingredients.

[<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3013/3020530736_8081d89336_m.jpg" alt="mints" width="180" height="240" />][1]This is actually a really good recipe if you want to make something uniquely you. You can really use any kind of extract you want (i.e. wintergreen, coconut, butterscotch, etc) and choose whichever food coloring you want. For instance, if you want something minty, use the peppermint extract and add green food coloring; butterscotch, add yellow food coloring; or leave it white when you add the coconut. This is a recipe that can be played with.

**Ingredients:**  
4 tbsp softened butter  
1/3 cup light corn syrup  
1 tsp peppermint extract  
1/2 tsp salt (optional)  
1 drop food coloring (optional)  
4-3/4 cups (or 1 lb) powdered sugar

**Directions:**

  1. Mix all ingredients minus the extract until smooth.
  2. Add the extract and mix thoroughly.
  3. Drop by teaspoons onto wax paper and let set until hardened.
