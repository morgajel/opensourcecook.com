The Pampered Chef has these eight different recipes that all use the same idea &#8211; making the dish end up looking like either a ring, braid or wreath.  Basically, it&#8217;s bread stuffed with a casserole and some of the dishes actually look really tempting.  I&#8217;ve already made the [Chicken and Broccoli Ring][1], which I also tried as a braid (not crazy about the braid, but its doable).  This time around, I&#8217;m attempting the wreath and using the Garden Vegetable Omelet recipe.

One thing I did with this recipe, and I&#8217;m not sure how well it&#8217;ll turn out, is I made the filling last night and I&#8217;m going to make the wreath this morning.  This is another dish Jesse is taking to work and I wanted the dish to retain some heat.  So I&#8217;m going to cook it before he heads in.  It&#8217;s been awhile since I sent anything hot in, so we&#8217;ll see how this works.

One other thing I did, which shouldn&#8217;t surprise anyone, is I really didn&#8217;t measure the veggies before adding them.  I ended up using a full red bell pepper, all of the tops from the asparagus spears and probably 1/3 of an onion (although I would say it was a rather large onion).  I&#8217;m not really sure if adding extra veggies is a bad thing, but it&#8217;s never harm a recipe in the past.

I have already found something I want to change, but it&#8217;s purely a selfish change since I cooked asparagus really has no appeal to me.  I&#8217;m really thinking I could exchange the asparagus for broccoli or another green veggie and it&#8217;ll still work.  Not totally sure, but it&#8217;s a thought.

**Ingredients:**  
4oz cream cheese, softened  
1/4 cup milk  
1 tbsp all-purpose flour  
8 eggs, divided  
1 tsp all-purpose dill mix  
1/4 tsp salt  
1/4 lb fresh asparagus spears, cut into 1-inch pieces (3/4 cup)  
1/2 cup diced red bell pepper  
1/3 cup chopped onion  
1 tbsp butter or margarine  
1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  In classic batter bowl, whisk cream cheese and milk; add flour and whisk until smooth.  Spearate 1 egg; reserve egg white.  Add the yolk, remaining 7 eggs, dill mix, salt and black pepper to cream cheese mixture; whisk until smooth.  Add asparagus, bell pepper and onion to bater bowl; mix well.
  2. Melt butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat.  Add egg mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, 4-6 minutes until eggs are set but still moist. Remove pan from heat.
  3. Unroll crescent dough; separate into triangles. Arrange triangles in a circle on Classic Round Stone with wide ends overlapping in the center and points toward outside. (There should be a 5-inch diameter opening in the center) Using Medium Scoop, scoop egg mixture evenly onto widest end of each triangle; sprinkle with cheese.  Bring points of triangles up over filling and tuck under wide ends of dough at center of ring. (Filling will not be completely covered.)  Brush with remaining lightly beaten egg white.
  4. Bake 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.
