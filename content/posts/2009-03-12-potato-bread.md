I have to admit, I&#8217;ve tried this recipe and I like this recipe, but I don&#8217;t really have anything else to say. It is one I make a lot though.

**Ingredients:**  
2 tbsp butter or margarine  
1-1/2 cups water  
2 tsp water  
2 tsp salt  
4 cups bread flour  
4 tsp sugar  
1/2 cup instant potato flakes  
2-1/2 tsp active dry yeast

**Directions:**  
Place all ingredients into the pan of the bread machine in the order suggested by the manufacturer. Select basic setting, select either light or medium crust and press start.
