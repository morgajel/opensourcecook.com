Here&#8217;s the chocolate cheesecake recipe I created awhile ago minus the raspberry and strawberry additions.

_**Chocolate Graham Cracker Pie Crust:**_  
This time, for the graham cracker crust, we&#8217;re using the recipe from [Terri&#8217;s cheesecake][1].

 **Ingredients:**  
8 tbsp butter  
1-1/2 cups crumbs (about 21 squares)  
4-1/2 tbsp sugar  
2-1/4 tsp heaping cocoa

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 375 F.
  2. Mix all ingredients together and pour into spring form pan. Bake at 375 F for 8 minutes.

_**Chocolate Cheesecake:**_  
The [first time around][2], the raspberry extract was barely there. So this time, I doubled the amount. Also, the two previous cheesecakes I tried used different kinds of chocolate and some people did prefer one over the other. With that thought in mind, we&#8217;re mixing the chocolate. The first attempt used baking chocolate bars and the second used semi-sweet chocolate chips. This time around, I&#8217;m using half the chocolate bars and half of the chips, so we&#8217;ll still end up with the same amount of chocolate.

I don&#8217;t know how much 8oz of chocolate chip actually is, but I used about 2 cups and that seemed to make the cheesecake a little too brittle.  So it&#8217;s definitely 2 cups.  If anyone finds out, let me know.

We still haven&#8217;t figured out how to stop the top from cracking while it&#8217;s cooling down.  If there&#8217;s a way to prevent this, we would like to know so please drop us an email.

 **Ingredients:**  
8oz semi-sweet chocolate, chopped  
8oz semi-sweet chocolate chips  
4 &#8211; 8oz pkgs cream cheese, softened  
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened  
1/3 cup milk  
4 eggs  
1 egg yolk  
Sifted powdered sugar (optional)  
Sifted unsweetened cocoa powder (optional)  
Fresh berries (optional)

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 F.
  2. Melt 1 pound chocolate in a heavy saucepan over very low heat, stirring constantly; cool. For tips on melting chocolate, I would check out [Hershey’s guide][3], it’s the one I use.
  3. Beat melted chocolate, cream cheese, the 1/2 cup butter or margarine, and 1/3 cup milk in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer on medium to high speed until combined. Add whole eggs and egg yolk all at once. Beat on low speed just until combined.
  4. Pour filling into the springform pan. Place the pan in a shallow baking pan on the oven rack. Bake in a 350 degree F oven about 55 minutes or until 1 to 2 inches of outside edge appear set when shaken gently.
  5. Remove springform pan from baking pan. Cool cheesecake in pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Use a small metal spatula to loosen cheesecake from sides of pan. Cool 30 minutes more. Remove sides of pan. Cool 1 hour; cover and chill at least 4 hours.
