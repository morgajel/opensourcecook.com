This is another great Pampered Chef recipe that I&#8217;ve been playing with and I can&#8217;t wait to try the different variations. The fresh strawberries are completely a garnish. So I&#8217;m thinking, with all the different types of jams out there, I&#8217;m wondering if the fruit couldn&#8217;t be played with. Instead of strawberry jam, why not raspberries? Then use raspberries as the garnish?

I have to say that I love the glaze on this recipe. Not only was it easy to make, but it can be used for so many other recipes. Between the ice cream and the chocolate, the glaze hardened up nicely on the cake and it added to the presentation of this dessert. If you&#8217;re looking for an elegant dessert to entertain with, one that doesn&#8217;t take a lot of time, then this is the one to do.

_Edited to Add on 2/6:_ Keep a look out for a variation to this recipe.  I have an idea to try something, but I don&#8217;t want to mention it just yet because I want to try it first.  Let&#8217;s just say it involves using white chocolate and I think it should work.

**Ingredients:**  
_Cake_  
1/4 cup plus 1 tbsp vegetable oil, divided  
1/2 cup milk chocolate morsels  
1 pkg (18.25oz) devil&#8217;s food cake mix  
3 eggs  
3/4 cup water  
1 jar (12oz) seedless strawberry jam, divided

_Glaze and Garnish_  
1/3 cup melted vanilla ice cream  
1 cup milk chocolate morsels  
1 qt fresh strawberries, divided  
Additional ice cream (optional)

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  2. Brush [fluted pan][1] with 1 tbsp of the oil using a [basting brush][2]. For cake, combine chocolate morsels and oil in [small batter bowl][3]. Microwave on HIGH 30-60 seconds or until melted and smooth, whisking after 30 seconds. In 4qt) [mixing bowl][4], combine cake mix, eggs, water, 1/2 cup of the jam and chocolate mixture; whisk until well blended. Pour batter into pan.
  3. Place pan in oven and bake for 45-50 minutes or until wooden pick inserted near center comes out clean.  Wipe rim of pan clean using paper towel, if necessary. Center a [large round platter][5] over pan and carefully invert. Without removing pan, let stand 10 minutes. Remove pan.
  4. For glaze, combine ice cream and chocolate morsels in [small micro-cooker][6]. Microwave on HIGH 20-60 seconds, stirring after each 20-second interval, until melted and smooth.
  5. To finish cake, place remaining jam into [a prep bowl][7] and microwave on HIGH 30 seconds or until melted; brush evenly over cake. Holding by stems, dip 16 of the strawberries into glaze; arrange around bottom edge of cake. Drizzle top of cake with remaining glaze. Slice remaining strawberries using [egg slicer][8]; place into center well of cake. Serve with additional ice cream, if desired.

**Cook&#8217;s Tip:** For an optional cooking method (and if you have a fluted stoneware pan), you can microwave the cake on HIGH for 9-12 minutes or until wooden pick inserted near center comes out clean. For best results, bake this cake in a 1000-watt microwave with a built-in turntable.
