It&#8217;s a really delicious cake that&#8217;s fairly easy to make as long as you have a little patience or not quite the perfectionist that I can be.

When you&#8217;re buying the ingredients, it&#8217;s important to get the ones I suggested. I know most cakes tend to be moist, but do **_NOT_** get the super moist cake mixes. They tend to be a little to pliable and will break apart when you try to manhandle them out of the pan and whatnot. Also, make sure you get the whipped frosting. We tried the creamy, but it tended to ooze down the sides and wouldn&#8217;t stick to the cake really well. The whipped frosting sticks a lot easier and I didn&#8217;t have to use as much of it.

Instead of using one cake and cutting it in half, I made two separate cakes and stuck them on top of each other. This made it so I didn&#8217;t end up getting three pieces when I really wanted two. The only problem with this method is that cakes tend to round out on the top, so when you stick another one on top of it, you end up with a groove around the edges. This is really easy to fix since all you have to do is cut off the top of the cake and level it out. I&#8217;m currently looking for a cake leveler so I don&#8217;t have to use a knife, but a sharp knife works really well too.

When we crushed the Oreos, Jesse decided to remove all of the filling this time around and he seems to like it better this way. He says the cream filling was a little overkill, but it&#8217;s completely up to you if you want to remove them or not.

**Ingredients:**  
2 packages of Dark Chocolate cake mix  
3 packages of whipped chocolate frosting  
2 packages of Jell-O Oreo pudding mix  
2 cups of cool whip  
3 cups milk  
1 package of Oreo cookies

**Directions:**

  1. Combine 3 cups cold milk and 2 packages of Oreo pudding mix in medium bowl. Beat with wire whisk 2 minutes or until well blended. Stir in 2 cups thawed cool whip. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or until set.
  2. Prepare and bake both cakes according to box directions. Cool completely.
  3. Take one cake and level the top off, making it flat. Layer Oreo mousse lavishly onto cake. Once completed, gently add the second cake on top of mousse.
  4. Frost all sides of the cake.
  5. Take 1/2 of a package of Oreos and remove all the filling. Crush the chocolate sides of the cookies until you get a fine powder. Once you have the powder, sprinkle over the cake and along the sides.
