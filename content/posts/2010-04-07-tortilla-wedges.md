This was a fun recipe I received from my friend Nikki that seemed to go over well with Jesse.  While I&#8217;m not usually a fan of many of the ingredients, I did try them and they were pretty good.  Myself, I couldn&#8217;t eat a lot of them, but that&#8217;s mainly because it was a little spicier than what I&#8217;m used to.  I have to admit, I didn&#8217;t try it with the salsa, so there may be a totally different taste once you add that. If you like Mexican and spicy, then definitely try this recipe.

Oh, and the amount of tortillas change depending on how much filling you use. If you like the filing to be thick, then you&#8217;ll need fewer tortillas; but if you like the filling to be light, then you&#8217;ll need more tortillas.

**Ingredients:**  
1 (8oz) brick cream cheese, softened  
1/2 cup sour cream  
1 (4oz) can chopped green chillies  
1/2 cup sliced green onions  
1 tbsp minced jalapeños (about 1 pepper)  
Salt (to taste)  
Pepper (to taste)  
10-20 flour tortillas  
Salsa (optional)

**Directions:**  
Combine first seven ingredients in large bowl or food processor and mix well. Spread generously on a tortilla, then cover with another tortilla. Cut into 8 wedge pieces. Serve with salsa.
