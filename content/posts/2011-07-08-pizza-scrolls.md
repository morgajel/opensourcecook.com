Another recipe from _[Great Gluten-Free Baking][1]_ by Louise Blair.

**Ingredients:**  
4-1/2 tsp active dried yeast  
1 tsp granulated sugar  
1 cup milk, warmed  
1 cup rice flour plus extra for dusting  
1 cup potato flour  
1 tsp gluten-free baking powder  
1 tsp xanthan gum  
pinch salt  
1 tbsp sunflower oil  
1 egg, beaten

_Filling_  
4 tbsp canned tomatoes, crushed  
1 cup grated mozzarella cheese  
1 cup grated cheddar cheese  
3oz wafer-thin ham, shredded  
handful fresh basil, chopped

**Directions:**

  1. Place the yeast, sugar and milk in a bowl and set aside for about 10 minutes, until frothy. In a large bowl, stir together the flours, baking powder, xanthan gum and the salt.
  2. ix the oil and egg into the yeast mixture and pour this into the flour mixture, using a fork to bring the mixture together. Tip it out onto a surface dusted lightly with rice flour and knead for 5 minutes, adding a little flour if the mixture becomes sticky. Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place for about 40 minutes, or until well risen.
  3. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. On the floured surface, roll the dough out to a rectangle approximately 12&#215;10 inches, spread with the crushed tomatoes, then sprinkle over the other toppings. Roll the pizza up from one long edge, then slice into eight pieces.
  4. Place the rolled-up scrolls, side by side, on a lightly oiled heavy baking sheet. They should be pushed up against each other so the sides are touching. Place in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, until golden.
