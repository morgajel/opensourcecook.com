I was curious if I could make white chocolate brownies and after looking at Rayna&#8217;s (from the [Naughty Editions Book Reviews][1]) recipe for [Death by Chocolate Brownies][2], I thought it would be really easy to switch out her chocolate for white.

The only major change I&#8217;m working on is whether I want to add the coffee or not. The original recipe calls for 1-1/2 teaspoons instant espresso powder or 2-3 teaspoons instant coffee crystals and I&#8217;m not sure if that will work as well with white chocolate as it does with chocolate.  However, for this first batch, I added the coffee (1-1/2 tsp coffee grounds) since it would be an easy fix the next time around.  _Update: Do not use coffee!  It was too powerful and totally overwhelmed all of the brownies.  A coffee drinker even said it wasn&#8217;t tasty._

As for the chocolate, I initially used 8 ounces of white baking chocolate, but while you could tell it was white chocolate, I didn&#8217;t think it was strong enough, so I&#8217;m adding another 2 ounces to the recipe.  Although, I am wondering if the strength of the white chocolate would increase if the coffee is taken out.  Coffee is strong after all.  Either way, I don&#8217;t believe adding more white chocolate would be a bad thing, whether it is 2 ounces or 4.

Something I did unintentionally, and I&#8217;m actually happy about, is I reduced the amount of butter that is used.  The original recipe calls for 10 tbsp, but for these, I stuck to one stick of butter (8 tbsp) and the chocolate wasn&#8217;t as liquidy as the original recipe &#8211; at this stage.  There was definitely a different look to it and I think adding the extra 2 tbsps would not have made it turn out well.  Granted, this may change once I actually taste the brownies, but considering how the chocolate looked when I pulled it from the microwave, I&#8217;m not upset I miscalculated that.

Side note: Adding nuts to the top is totally optional. Whenever I include nuts within the recipe, I like to have them on top so it’s easily recognizable that it’s not something for anyone with nut allergies.  Also, I’ll get a better picture once I cut.

**Ingredients:**  
10 ounces white chocolate  
8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter  
1-1/4 cups sugar  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
1/2 teaspoon baking powder  
2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
tiny drops almond extract  
3 large eggs  
2/3 cup all-purpose flour (extra half to a full cup for cake-like brownies)  
3/4 cup toasted pecans (optional)

**Directions:**

  1. Pre-heat oven to 325F. Adjust an oven rack to a lower-middle position.
  2. Line an 8 inch square metal baking pan with foil or parchment paper.
  3. Mix and bake brownies according to type desired – Fudge-like or Cake-like.
  4. Cool brownies in pan on a wire rack. When cool enough to handle, use the foil or parchment to pull the brownies from pan. Completely cool brownies on rack, at least 3 hours for fugdey and 1 hour for cakey. Be patient, or the brownies won’t cut into nice squares and you’ll have a mess on hand. … Cut and enjoy!!!

Put chocolates and butter in a microwave safe bowl. Microwave on high, stirring every 30 seconds, until chocolate is almost melted. Remove from microwave, and stir to melt remaining bits of chocolate. Alternatively, you can melt the choco/butter/coffee combo over a pan of simmering water: put a heat-proof bowl over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl doesn’t touch the water, and stir until everything is melted. Remove from heat.

Whisk in sugar, salt, baking powder, and extracts into the chocolate mixture. Then whisk in the eggs, one at a time, mixing each one completely before adding the next one. After adding the eggs, whisk the mixture until smooth and glossy. Add flour; whisk until just incorporated. Do not over mix. Stir in the nuts.

Pour batter into the prepared pan; flatten the top with a spatula. Bake until a toothpick poked into the center comes out with wet crumbs, 55 to 65 minutes. Start checking at 40 minutes, oven may vary.

Melt chocolate using the above instructions. Let rest. Combine both mixtures together. Sift flour, salt, baking powder together. Then fold in/add that to the choco/butter mix. That should be all the ingredients but the nuts.

Pour batter into the prepared pan; flatten the top with a spatula. Bake until a toothpick poked into the center comes out with clean, 45 to 55 minutes. (If your oven is notorious for overheating, start checking around 35 minutes.)
