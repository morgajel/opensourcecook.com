This really isn&#8217;t a recipe, but something we&#8217;ve been experiementing with for awhile now and I thought I would share our results. Basically, we tend to have pancakes a lot (it&#8217;s a great last minute dinner) and we&#8217;ve been trying different fruits in the batter to see what we can come up with. We&#8217;ve tried the standard blueberry, but we didn&#8217;t stop there.

When I add fruit to pancakes, I don&#8217;t throw all the fruit into the batter and then pour into a pan. My father does that and I&#8217;m not crazy with the end results. You can end up with fruit cooking straight on the pan instead of in the pancakes and it can taste a little funny. Instead, I will pour the pancake batter into the pan and then put the fruit on the pancake after a couple of seconds sitting in the pan. Once the fruit is in the batter, I&#8217;ll take more batter (usually using either a fork or whisk) and dab it on top of the fruit, making sure all the fruit is covered. This way, when I flip the pancake, none of the fruit is touching the pan and it&#8217;s being cooked from the inside.

Anyway, here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve found with the following fruit:

**Raspberries:**  
It&#8217;s not bad, but it can be a weird combination with maple syrup. Something I found that works out really well is smashing the raspberries before putting them in the batter. The first pancake I tried, I didn&#8217;t smash the berries and when Jesse cut into it, he found molten areas of raspberries that wasn&#8217;t all that fun to be burned with. The second time around, I smashed them and they came out great. It took fewer raspberries for each pancake and you didn&#8217;t get overpowered in a single bite. Instead, it was spread out a lot more.

Jesse wasn&#8217;t crazy about the raspberries in the pancakes, but he only had that first pancake where I didn&#8217;t smash them up. So that may make a difference.

**Peaches:**  
This was really good. The peaches added a sweetness that worked well with powdered sugar and even maple syrup. I made sure I cut the peaches up into small tidbits and sprinkled them all over the pancake and it cooked really beautifully. The flavor wasn&#8217;t overpowering and it added something a little fun.

**Bananas:**  
Ian loves bananas and we had a couple sitting around, so I thought I would throw a couple into the batter for a change. I thought they were really good, but Jesse doesn&#8217;t think he liked it to well. The bananas did add a strange texture and taste to the pancakes, but it was a good contrast in my opinion. Again, I cut the bananas into small tidbits and sprinkled around the batter.

**Apples:**  
This was also a surprise. I can&#8217;t remember what type of apple I used, but again, I cut them into tiny tidbits and they came out really good. I want to say I used a macintosh, but don&#8217;t quote me on that since I remember the apples adding a bitterness to the pancake that counterbalanced the sweetness of the maple syrup. I&#8217;m not a fan of maple syrup, it&#8217;s too sweet for me, but with apple pancakes, it was actually really good.
