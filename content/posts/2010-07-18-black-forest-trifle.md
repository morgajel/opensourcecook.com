I am always looking for new recipes to try in my trifle bowl and this one sounds like a really great one to do. I manged to snag this one from the Pampered Chef, so something tells me it&#8217;s going to be ridiculously easy and tasty as well.

**Ingredients:**  
1 pkg (18-21 oz) brownie mix (plus ingredients to make cake-like brownies)  
2 bars (1.55 ounces each) milk chocolate candy, divided  
3 cups cherry pie filling  
1 tsp almond extract  
1/2 cup cranberry-cherry juice  
2 cups cold 2% milk  
2 pkg (3.3 oz each) white chocolate instant pudding and pie filling  
1 container (8 oz) frozen whipped topping, thawed

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Prepare brownie mix according to package directions for cake-like brownies; spread batter over bottom of large stone bar pan. Bake 18-20 minutes or until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool completely.
  2. Loosen brownie from sides of bar pan and invert onto a large cutting board. Cut brownie into 1-in. cubes; set aside. Chop 11/2 of the chocolate bars using a food chopper. Reserve remaining chocolate for garnish.
  3. Combine pie filling and almond extract in a small bowl; set aside 1/2 cup for garnish. Stir juice into bowl.
  4. Pour milk into a large bowl; add pudding mix and whisk until mixture begins to thicken. Fold in whipped topping.
  5. To assemble trifle, place half of the brownie cubes into bottom of trifle bowl. Layer with half of the pie filling mixture. Sprinkle with half of the chopped chocolate; top with half of the pudding mixture. Repeat layer one time.
  6. Make chocolate curls with reserved chocolate using a vegetable peeler (see Cook&#8217;s Tip). Garnish top of trifle with reserved pie filling mixture and chocolate curls. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes before serving.

**Cook’s Tips:** To make chocolate curls, hold the Vegetable Peeler across the short side of the chocolate bar. Using even pressure, push the blade away from you to create curls.

This trifle can be assembled several hours before serving, or even the night before.
