Yes, I know I already have a Zucchini Bread recipe, but this one was my grandmother&#8217;s so I have to add it.  I loved this recipe growing up, but it was different enough for Jesse which is why we have two on the site.

It doesn&#8217;t take too many zucchinis to get 2 grated cups worth. When I made this, I had 3 good sized zucchinis and it gave me enough to make 4 loaves. So there&#8217;s no reason to get the largest veggie out there.

**Ingredients**:  
4 eggs (beat until foamy)  
1 cup oil  
2 cups sugar  
2 tsp vanilla  
2 cups grated zucchini  
3-1/2 cups flour  
1-1/2 tsp baking powder  
1/2 tsp salt  
1 tsp nutmeg  
1 tsp cinnamon  
3/4 tsp baking soda

**Directions**:  
Mix together eggs, oil, sugar, vanilla, and zucchini until well blended. Add remaining ingredients. Pour batter into 2 loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees for 50-55 minutes.
