**Ingredients:**  
1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour  
1/2 tsp salt  
1/2 cup shortening  
4 to 5 tbsp cold water  
1/2 cups all-purpose flour  
1/4 cup sugar  
1/4 cup butter or margarine  
Apples  
Cinnamon  
Sugar

**Directions:**

  1. _For the crust:_ I mix flour and salt first, then add the Cisco. Using a fork mix until dough looks like it is crumbs. Then add water, if it doesn&#8217;t appear to hold together then add the extra tablespoon of water. Don&#8217;t go over the amount that is listed above.
  2. Roll out and place into pie shell, pushing it next to edges then using a fork, poke holes around the sides and on the bottom of pan.
  3. _For the inside of the pie_: Cut apples into slice and layer, in between layers sprinkle with cinnamon & sugar. Load the apples high because they will cook down. Before adding topping put three dabs of butter on the top. (roughly a tablespoon size dab)
  4. _For the topping:_ Mix flour and sugar together then add the butter. Mix until it crumbs.Â  Bake at 350 for 50 to 60 minutes or until top is golden brown.

**Notes:** For two pies or 1 double crust pie: 2 cups of flour, 1 tsp of salt, 2/3 cups shortening, 6 tbsp of cold water if not right then add one more but don&#8217;t go over 7 tbsp
