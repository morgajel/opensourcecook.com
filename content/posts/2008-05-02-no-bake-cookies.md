I love no bake cookies and Jesse can&#8217;t get enough of them.  There was awhile there that he had me making them every weekend and they were usually gone by the following Monday.

I&#8217;m currently working on trying to get a recipe down for White Chocolate no bake cookies, but I haven&#8217;t found one that works for me yet.  I did try one, but I didn&#8217;t like the marshmallows that were added in.  I have about three different recipes pinned up on the refrigerator just waiting for me to experiment with, so I&#8217;ll try and get it up soon. (_ETA on 1/26/09): This is still true today&#8230;still working on this_)

Hershey&#8217;s now has special dark cocoa powder! Love no bake cookies and I&#8217;ve found that using the special dark cocoa powder doesn&#8217;t make them as sweet. Which means you can go through them faster
