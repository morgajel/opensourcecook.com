Originally I was thinking of making a basic white cake with lemon mousse filling, but then I made the mousse.  The mousse was good, but after tasting it, I thought the cake would be a little on the plain side, so I changed the cake.  I&#8217;m hoping this works.

Now, there is one major difference between this cake and my other ones&#8230;I&#8217;m not using the normal rectangle size pan, but instead a 9&#8243; round pan.  Hence the reason why I&#8217;m only using one cake mix instead of two.

I have a friend who loves lemon flavor anything and when I was thinking of what kind of filling to use on a white cake, lemon instantly came to mind.

When I first made this, I was a little concerned that the flavoring wouldn&#8217;t be there, but after it sat in the refrigerator for a few hours, the flavor came out.  It&#8217;s not overpowering, but you can definitely tell it&#8217;s lemon.  The only complaint I have with this is it didn&#8217;t firm up all that much.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it did, but once I started putting it inbetween the cake layers, it started the oozing process and it seemed to be more of a problem than normal.  Usually, when I use instant pudding as a mousse base, I use cool whip instead of whipping the cream by hand.  That may have been the issue.  I think next time, I&#8217;ll try using cool whip.  If anyone wants to try way instead of what I have below, the recipe is: 2 pkg instant pudding, 1-1/2 cup milk, and 1 cup cool whip.  Combine cold milk and pudding mix and whisk for 2 minutes or until well blended.  Stir in 1 cup thawed cool whip until blended.  Refrigerate.

**Ingredients:**  
2 packages lemon instant pudding  
Milk  
2 cups heavy cream, whipped  
2 rounded tablespoons sugar

**Directions:**

  1. In a medium bowl, stir pudding and milk and set aside.
  2. Beat whipping cream and sugar until peaks form. Add about 1/4 of the whipped cream to the pudding and gently fold it in to lighten it. Fold the remaining whipped cream into pudding.

This is my standard cake recipe using package cake mixes. However, this time around, I made this one to be a round cake instead of the large rectangle. So there&#8217;s a couple of little changes.

**Ingredients:**  
1 packages of French Vanilla cake mix  
1 (16.2oz) package of whipped white frosting

**Directions:**

  1. Prepare cake according to package directions, using the round 9&#8243; pan size setting. You need to make two round cakes. Cool completely.
  2. After the cakes have cooled completely, layer the german chocolate mousse lavishly onto the top of one cake. Once completed, gently add the second cake on top of the mousse.
  3. Frost all sides of the cake.
