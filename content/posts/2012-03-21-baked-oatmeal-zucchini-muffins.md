I&#8217;ve been having a difficult time getting Simon to eat veggies, so I&#8217;m always on the lookout for finding new ways to hide them in the foods he already enjoys.  I recently found [Suger-Free Mom&#8217;s Personal Sized Baked Oatmeal][1] recipe and the boys loved it.  So I started thinking of ways I could add veggies to the recipes without turning the boys off.

One thought that kept popping into my head involved zucchini.  The local grocery store has these fabulous zucchini muffins and I haven&#8217;t been able to find a really good recipe for some. Plus, with Simon&#8217;s wheat-allergy, any recipe I do find, I want it to be wheat free as well (or at least be able to convert to wheat free).  As I was mixing the ingredients for the [Baked Oatmeal Muffins][2] (as I&#8217;m calling them), the mixture of applesauce and mashed bananas really reminded me of what grated zucchini looks like when you make [Zucchini Bread][3].  So I started thinking, why not substitute the applesauce and bananas with zucchini?  So I did.

I have made a few other changes, but mainly because of what I had on hand when I made them.  Grated zucchini can be kind of watery, especially if you&#8217;re pulling it out of the freezer, so make sure you drain it before adding it to the mixture.  You really don&#8217;t want the additional liquid as this recipe is already pretty spongy before it gets baked. My zucchini had been frozen in 2 cup increments, so I increased that part of the recipe to 4 cups just because I didn&#8217;t want to store 1 cup of grated zucchini.  So if you wanted, you could reduce the amount of zucchini by one cup.

Because of how soggy the batter was, I decreased the amount of milk from 2 3/4 cups to 2 1/4 cups.  But honestly, that was mainly because I ran out of milk.  So again, if you wanted to use the 2 3/4 cups, go ahead, but I really don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessary.  To help with the sogginess, I also increased the amount of oats from 5 cups to 6.  Honestly, all these changes to try and make the batter less soggy didn&#8217;t really work.  \*grin\*  It still remained pretty soft and malleable, so I&#8217;m just counting the additional cup of oats as more fiber.  You can never have too much of that, right?

So what was the end result you ask?  Well, it needs work.  The idea works, but there&#8217;s not enough sweetness. It tastes like it has veggies in it and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll get it by the boys, but we&#8217;ll see.  I&#8217;m thinking I need to cut the zucchini to 2 cups and leave the 2 cups of applesauce in it.  Or maybe just a cup of applesauce.  Or maybe adding some brown sugar, instead of white sugar, would work as well.  In either case, they didn&#8217;t come out bad, but the recipe can use some work.
