The dipping sauce for this, we use Thai Sweet Chili Sauce. I am not a fan of hot sauces, however, this is not too hot, but just right. Plus it helps that it is a dipping sauce so you can adjust your intake if need by.

**Ingredients**  
1 pound think sliced boneless, skinless chicken breasts  
1/4 cup all-purpose flour  
1 egg, beaten  
1 cup Panko, Japanese bread crumbs  
Â¼ cup sweet chili sauce (or other dipping sauce)

**Directions**

  1. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Working with one breast at a time, dust with flour, coat with egg and then dredge into panko until thoroughly coated.
  2. In a well-oiled large skillet over medium-high heat, brown chicken on each side until golden, about 2-3 minutes per side. If you need to do this in more then 1 batch, place cooked chicken in a 250-degree oven for a couple of minutes. Serve chicken with dipping sauce.

**Yields:** 4 servings
