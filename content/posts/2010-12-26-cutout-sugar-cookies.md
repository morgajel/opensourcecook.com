I love sugar cookies and the monkey loves to make them for Santa Claus.  I&#8217;ve tried a few recipes before and I haven&#8217;t really been happy with the way they&#8217;ve turned out.  Recently, I found a sugar cookie (non-cutout) recipe that used powdered sugar instead of cane sugar and I liked it.  So I went looking for a cutout recipe that used the powdered rather than the regular and I have to say &#8211; love it.  Not only did they turn out great, but I love the icing recipe that was included too.

The original recipe came from [Taste of Home][1] and normally there&#8217;s something I would change, but this time, I can&#8217;t think of anything.  This recipe for cutout sugar cookies is simply fabulous and it&#8217;s awesome.  Although, I am wondering how these would taste as chocolate.

That would be a variation &#8211; adding chocolate to the mixture.  Like I said, I&#8217;m not sure what it would do to the dough, but Jesse really wants me to add chocolate to the icing.  I have a bunch of icing left over (this recipe does make a lot), so I&#8217;m going to attempt it and see what happens.  Although, I&#8217;m going to need something to put the icing on, so I&#8217;ll probably make regular sugar cookies.  Cutouts are fun, but I&#8217;m still a drop &#8217;em kind of girl.  Wait, I do know one thing I need to change &#8211; my cookie cutters.  The dough does rise a little, so if you&#8217;re cutters are a good size, expect giant cookies.
