I think I need to find a few more Amish style recipes &#8211; the last two I&#8217;ve tried have been fabulous! Awhile back, I was looking for a sugar cookie recipe since Jesse wasn&#8217;t a fan of the one I had. As I was looking, I came across this recipe over at [Taste of Home][1] and I noticed it used powdered sugar instead of the run of the mill coarse sugar. I was intrigued and since Jesse&#8217;s #1 complaint was the cookies weren&#8217;t light and fluffy, I thought I would give it a try.

Oh my god were these wonderful. They were perfect and I seriously can&#8217;t wait to make them again.

**Ingredients**  
1 cup butter, softened  
1 cup vegetable oil  
1 cup sugar  
1 cup confectioners&#8217; sugar  
2 eggs  
1 tsp vanilla extract  
4-1/2 cups all-purpose flour  
1 tsp baking soda  
1 tsp cream of tartar

**Directions**

  1. In large bowl, beat the butter, oil and sugars. Beat in eggs until well blended. Beat in vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda and cream of tartar; gradually add to creamed mixture.
  2. Drop by small teaspoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 375Â° for 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.

**Yield:** about 5 dozen.
