    Pale Green hotsauce

</div>

**Ingredients**

  * 2 tbsp canola oil
  * 8 jalapenos
  * 5 serrano
  * 1 poblano
  * 1/3 small red onion

  * 1/2 cup white vinegar
  * 1 cup water

  * 1/2 tbsp garlic powder
  * 1/2 tbsp black pepper
  * 1/4 tbsp cumin
  * 1 tbsp lime juice

**Directions:**

  1.  Quarter peppers and slice onion. I used the seeds and ribs of the peppers for optimal heat.
  2.  Sautee in a small sauce pan with oil on medium heat. Keep a lid on it but stir often.
  3.  When a majority of the peppers start to soften and the skins peel, add water and vinegar. Let boil for 20-30 minutes, stirring often.
  4.  Let it cool a bit, then throw it in a blender. Puree the crap out of it, then add the garlic powder, black pepper, cumin and lime juice, then puree the crap out of it again.
  5.  Once it cools a bit more, pour it through a strainer into a funnel into your receptacle. You&#8217;ll need to smush it around with a spoon and will end up with 1/4 cup of fibrous paste.
  6.  Cap it and let it cool, then put it in the fridge for a few days.

Total prep and cooking time was about an hour.
