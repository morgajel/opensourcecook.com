For those of you who don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ve been collecting recipes for a long time and I haven&#8217;t added them all to Open Source just yet. Nope, all the recipes on here are ones I&#8217;ve tried and can tell you about. However, I have a ton that I want to try and those I keep in my cookbook. Since the switchover, the link has been broken, but now I have all of my recipes back up. Here&#8217;s a sample of something I want to try and haven&#8217;t yet:

1 (1/4 ounce) package yeast  
3/4 cup water (110-115 degrees)  
1/2 cup shortening  
1 teaspoon salt  
1/4 cup sugar  
1 egg  
1/3 cup cocoa  
2-1/4 cups flour  
1 teaspoon softened butter  
1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon  
chopped nuts (optional)

_Icing ingredients_

1/2 teaspoon vanilla

**Directions:**

  1. In medium bowl,dissolve yeast in water.  Stir in shortening, salt, sugar, egg, cocoa, and 1 cup flour. Beat 2 minutes on medium speed of mixer, or 300 vigorous strokes by hand. Scrape side of bowl, stir in remaining flour; blend well. Cover and let rise in warm place until double (about 1 hour). Stir dough down by beating 25 strokes.
  2. Turn soft dough into well floured surface; roll into 8&#215;12-inch rectangle. Spread with softened butter and sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar mixture. Roll up beginning with wide edge.Pinch edges together. Cut into 12 pieces. Place in greased 9&#215;13-inch pan. Let rise until doubled (about 40 minutes) Bake at 375°F for 25 minutes.
  3. Combine icing ingredients, adding enough cream for good spreading consistency. Spread on rolls immediately and then sprinkle with nuts if desired. Serve warm. Can also use favorite cream cheese icing to frost.
