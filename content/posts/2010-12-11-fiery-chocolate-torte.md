A while ago, Jesse wanted to take something into work, but he didn&#8217;t really know what.  I had just gotten the [_Simple Sweet_][1] cookbook from the Pampered Chef, so I had him browse through it.  He ended up coming across this recipe and kept coming back to it. I don&#8217;t have much of a spice tolerance, so I was iffy on it, but I&#8217;ll admit to being curious to see how it would turn out.

I&#8217;m not sure if I messed up my measurements with the cayenne pepper or not, but this definitely came out spicy.  The recipe calls for 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper in the cake mix and 1/4 tsp in the frosting and I can&#8217;t remember if I did use the teaspoon or if I grabbed the tablespoon instead.  For me (and I heard for others as well), the cake was a bit too spicy, but I don&#8217;t want to change the measurements in case I did screw it up and the original ones are far better.  So, if you do try this, just be warned that it may end up spicier than you think.

I did double the frosting recipe. There simply wasn&#8217;t enough to frost the entire cake. I don&#8217;t know if I made mine too thick or what, but be advised that it&#8217;s already been doubled once.  One thing I would recommend is letting the frosting cool a little before attempting to frost the cake.  It&#8217;ll make it a little easier to spread.

I&#8217;m not sure what size box of devil&#8217;s food cake I used, but I didn&#8217;t measure out the amount.  According to the recipe, it says to use 1 &#8211; 9oz package of devils food cake or 1-3/4 cups of an 18.25oz box; I&#8217;m not sure how much of a difference this made to the recipe.

The cake itself, aside from the spiciness, was pretty good.  If the spice was cut back a little, I would definitely make it again.  However, I have to be honest, this is probably a recipe I won&#8217;t make again unless it&#8217;s requested.  I&#8217;m just not a fan of spicy chocolate.
