I haven&#8217;t tried this one yet, but considering how cold it has been lately, that may soon change.Â  This recipe came from Nikki and she says it&#8217;s really good, so if anyone does try it before me, let me know how it turns out.

**Ingredients:**  
2 pounds potatoes (peeled and cubed)  
32 ounces broth (chicken or veggie)  
3 cups broccoli  
3 cups cheddar cheese (shredded)  
2 cups onion (diced)  
salt and pepper to taste  
2 tbs. Butter

**Directions:**

  1. Saute the onions in the butter. Do not brown.
  2. Add onions, potatoes, and broth. Bring to a boil and simmer until potatoes are tender (about 15 min.).
  3. Add the broccoli and continue to simmer until the broccoli is cooked (5 min.).
  4. Transfer half of the mixture to a food processor or blender and puree (or use immersion blender).
  5. Add the puree back into the pot.
  6. Salt and pepper to taste.
  7. Add the cheddar cheese and warm the soup until the cheese is melted.
