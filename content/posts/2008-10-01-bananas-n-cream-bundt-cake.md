When an opportunity came up to use it, I couldn&#8217;t pass it up. This [recipe][2] came from Oma Rollison over at Allrecipes.

The cake actually came out pretty good and I like how easy it was to flip out of the pan.  Everyone at my mom&#8217;s group seemed to like it and the only critique I heard about it was that it seemed like it would be good heated up and spread with butter.  It came off tasting more like a banana bread than a cake, which I could definitely see.

One thing I did mess with, is I made this recipe as muffins as well for the kids, but instead of adding the sour cream, I used chocolate chips and made chocolate chip banana muffins.  I figured the kids would like that more than just straight bananas, but the odd things was, the moms liked the muffins more than the cake.  So I may try this recipe again, but getting rid of the sour cream and adding the chocolate chips to see if that works out.  So you may see a recipe like that sooner or later.

One thing I would change about this is the confectioner&#8217;s sugar on top.  If you&#8217;re planning on making this in order to take somewhere, the powdered sugar really doesn&#8217;t transports well.  When I had taken the tin foil off at our gathering, all of the powdered sugar was gone and it left just the cake.  Since there wasn&#8217;t any icing, it was just a banana bread loaf.  So, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m including the powdered sugar icing below.  I would drizzle a little of that over the cake instead of just sprinkling it on.

**Ingredients:**  
1/3 cup shortening  
1-1/4 cups sugar  
2 eggs  
1 tsp vanilla extract  
1-1/4 cups mashed ripe bananas  
2 cups all-purpose flour  
1-1/4 tsp baking powder  
1 tsp baking soda  
1/2 tsp salt  
1 cup sour cream  
3/4 cup chopped walnuts (optional)  
confectioners&#8217; sugar

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  2. In a mixing bowl, cream the shortening and sugar. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Blend in vanilla. Add bananas and mix well.
  3. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; add to the creamed mixture alternately with sour cream, stirring just until combined. Stir in walnuts.
  4. Pour into a greased and floured 10-in. fluted tube pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50 minutes or until cake tests done.
  5. Cool 10 minutes in pan before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with confectioners&#8217; sugar before serving.
