This recipe from _[Great Gluten-Free Baking][1]_ by Louise Blair was originally called _Passion Cake Squares_, however I just didn&#8217;t think that name fit.  For one, the cake came out way more like a carrot cake than anything fruity.  I don&#8217;t know why, but whenever I heard &#8220;passion cake&#8221; I think more of pineapple and the tropics than carrots.  So while there is pineapple in the cake, it&#8217;s more as a sweetener than for flavor in my opinion.  So for myself, I&#8217;m adjusting the name to _Sweet Carrot Cake_.  I think it reflects it a little more.

If you haven&#8217;t guessed already, I had the chance to try this one recently and I have to say it came out better than I thought it would.  I&#8217;m not totally crazy about the topping (a little too cream cheesy for me), but it works.  Jesse wasn&#8217;t crazy about the raisin surprise, so I did change that to being optional.  They didn&#8217;t really bother me, but then I knew they were there.  Ian says he likes it, but then again, he really hasn&#8217;t asked for more, so I&#8217;m not sure if he&#8217;s just saying that or if he did but just forgot about it.

Overall, not a bad recipe and one I&#8217;ll probably end up making again (with a few minor adjustments, which I&#8217;ve already made below).

**Ingredients:**  
1 cup brown rice flour  
1-1/2 cups granulated sugar  
2 tsp gluten-free baking powder  
1 tsp xanthan gum  
1 tsp ground cinnamon  
2/3 cup corn oil  
2 eggs, beaten  
few drops vanilla extract  
4-5 medium carrots (about 12oz), grated  
1/2 cup shredded coconut  
1/3 cup canned crushed pineapple, drained  
1/4 cup golden raisins (optional)

_Topping:_  
1 cup cream cheese  
2 tbsp clear honey  
1/2 cup walnuts, chopped (optional)

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour an 8in square bake pan. Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, xanthan gum and cinnamon together into a large bowl. Add the oil, eggs and vanilla extract and beat well.
  2. Fold in the carrots, coconut, pineapple and golden raisins and spoon the mixture into the prepared pan. Place in the preheated oven for about 1 hour or until a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean. Remove from the oven and cool in the pan.
  3. Beat together the cream cheese and honey, and smooth over the cake, then sprinkle the nuts, if using on top. Cut into 16 squares.
