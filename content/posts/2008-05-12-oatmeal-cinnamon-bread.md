I originally found the recipe for Oatmeal Cinnamon Bread to be for a single loaf and found that it took a lot longer than 1 hour and by the time it was cooked through, it was starting to burn on top. So, I changed the recipe to 2 loaves, but I haven&#8217;t adjusted the time yet.

So I&#8217;m playing with the time today. First off, I should mention that I didn&#8217;t have any dark brown sugar, but instead had light brown. So, to make up for the difference in sweetness, I added an additional 1/2 cup of light brown sugar to the mixture.

Once you split the batter into two loaf pans, I think the time actually works out.Â  I baked the breads for 45 minutes, but I ended up leaving it in for a few extra minutes.Â  So, the time is good.

I remember what I really liked about this recipe&#8230;it smelled like fresh baked oatmeal cookies. Which makes sense since it is oatmeal, but it tastes like it as well.Â  It&#8217;s softer than cookies, but it still has that oatmeal cookie taste to it.

**Ingredients:**  
1 cup Oats, quick cooking  
1-1/2 cups Water  
1-3/4 cups all-purpose Flour  
1 tsp Baking soda  
1/2 tsp Salt  
1 tsp Cinnamon  
8 tbsp (1 stick) softened Butter or Margarine  
1 cup Sugar  
1 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar  
2 large Eggs  
1 tsp Vanilla

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour two 9&#215;5 inch loaf pans.
  2. Place oats in a small heatproof bowl. Place water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Pour boiling water over oats. Set aside.
  3. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon in a small bowl and mix well.
  4. Place butter in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer set at high speed until creamy. Add granulated sugar and brown sugar gradually, beating constantly until well blended. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla extract.
  5. Gradually add flour mixture to creamed mixture and beat until smooth. Stir in oats mixture. Spoon batter into prepared pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted in center of loaf comes out clean, about 1 hour.
  6. Cool in loaf pan for 10 minutes. Transfer bread to a wire rack to cool completely.
