This just seems like a great way to continuously have fruit on hand. This is a recipe my grandmother used to make all the time and it was fabulous. is a delicious quick snack that gets more potent the longer it sits! (Thanks for sending this recipe, both mom and I have been looking for it because weâ€™ve been wanting to make it again)

**Ingredients:**  
3/4 sugar  
1 cup of peaches, canned and drained  
1 cup of pineapple, canned and drained  
1 cup of maraschino cherries, canned & drained

**Directions:**

  1. In a bowl, mix all ingredients together and store in a closed jar (but not air tight).
  2. Every 2 to 3 weeks, empty fruit into bowl, add chopped fruit and sugar. Mix well. Wash and dry jar.

**Tip:** Never let fruit get lower than 2 cups before adding fruit. Never store in tightly sealed jar as it could explode. Good on ice cream, plain cake or all alone.
