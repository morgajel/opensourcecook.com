This is actually a really simple recipe and easy to make if you have everything on hand. Even if you don&#8217;t have the meat, you probably have the rest of it, so it&#8217;s a little on the cheap side as well.

The recipe originally called for cream instead of the milk, but I didn&#8217;t have the cream and used the milk instead and it still thicken up pretty well while it was on the heat.  Personally, so far, I see no reason to use the cream and make this dish any more fatty than it needs to be.

Overall, the dish was really good, but I did make a few adjustments.  The recipe called for a cup of breadcrumbs for the topping and that was just too much.  The breadcrumbs didn&#8217;t really&#8230;.do anything.  In some areas, it worked, but in others, it was like I had just put them on.  So there were too many.  Plus, Jesse thought it was a little runny since I used milk instead of cream, so I&#8217;m adjusting that by adding a little more flour.  The milk thicken up nicely over the heat, after mixing it with the flour, butter, and onions; so I figured if I add a little more flour, it should work out perfectly.

This is one I will definitely be making again since it&#8217;s a nice change from hamburgers and chicken.

**Ingredients:**  
2 cups 1/2% milk  
4 cups cubed deli turkey  
3 cups cubed deli ham  
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese  
1 cup chopped onions (or to taste)  
1/4 cup butter or margarine  
1/2 cup all-purpose flour  
1 tsp dill weed  
1/8 tsp nutmeg  
1/2 cup dry breadcrumbs  
2 tbsp butter or margarine  
1/4 tsp dill weed  
1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese  
1/4 cup chopped walnuts

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  2. In a large bowl, combine turkey, ham and cheese; set aside.
  3. In a saucepan, sauté onion in butter until tender. Add flour, stir to form a paste. Gradually add cream, stirring constantly. Bring to a boil, boil 1 minute or until thick. Add dill, mustard and nutmeg; mix well.
