Mmm&#8230;I love sugar cookie dough. I&#8217;m tempted to tweak the ingredient amounts after making the recipe I originally found. However, since I haven&#8217;t tried this recipe yet, I won&#8217;t mess with it. My thought process, if you want more than 1-2 dozen cookies, double the recipe. I tried a recipe similar to this (the only difference was I rolled the dough balls in sugar and baked them) and it told me it made 60 cookies when in reality it only made just 34 cookies. Of course, sugar cookie dough is good and I probably would&#8217;ve had an even 3 dozen if I hadn&#8217;t snacked on the dough.

This is another recipe I snagged from [Better Home & Gardens][1].

1 cup butter, softened  
1 cup sugar  
1 tsp baking powder  
1/4 tsp salt  
1 egg  
1 tsp vanilla  
2-1/4 cups all-purpose flour  
Powdered Sugar Icing (optional)

**Directions:**

  1. Beat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds. Add 1 cup of the sugar, the baking powder, and salt. Beat until combined, scraping side of bowl occasionally. Beat in egg and vanilla until combined. Beat in as much flour as you can with the mixer. Stir in any remaining flour. Divide dough in half. Cover and chill dough in the refrigerator for 1 to 3 hours or until easy to handle.
  2. Preheat oven to 375F. Roll each half of the dough to 1/8-inch thickness, on a lightly floured surface. Cut dough with a floured cookie cutter. Place cutouts 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.
  3. Bake in preheated oven about 8 minutes or until edges are set. Transfer cookies to wire racks and let cool. If desired, spread with Powdered Sugar Icing. Let stand until slightly set; pipe icing in decorative designs over iced cookies. Let stand until icing is set.

**Tip:** For a colorful platter of cookies, roll the dough balls in different colored sugars instead of the white granulated sugar.

**To store:** Place cookies in layers separated by pieces of waxed paper in an airtight container; cover. Store at room temperature for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw cookies, if frozen, before serving.

**Powdered Sugar Icing:** Stir together 3 cups powdered sugar, 2 to 3 tablespoons milk, and 1 teaspoon vanilla in a medium bowl to make of piping or spreading consistency. Divide icing and tint portions with desired food coloring. Makes about 2 cups.
