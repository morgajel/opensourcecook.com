For some reason, a pineapple upside down cake has been in the back of my mind and since it involves mixing, I thought I would give it a try. However, I really enjoy making cakes with fillings and stuff in the center (it makes them so much more interesting), so I decided to do a double layer cake, with a twist.

On my first attempt with this recipe, I made it very basic. I took a generic pineapple upside down cake recipe and made 2 pans worth. Then I placed one on top of the other. It wasn&#8217;t that bad, but the pineapple topping that is there for one cake isn&#8217;t great as a filling. One of Jesse&#8217;s&#8230;complaints/musings&#8230;was that it was a lot of cake with very little something something. It was a little too dry. So it got me thinking. Why not fill it with a pineapple mousse instead?

For my second attempt, I was thinking of using [this mousse recipe][2] I found over at Rachel Ray&#8217;s site; but I wanted the mousse to be something that was easy to do, so I went another route.  I  may end up trying the pineapple mousse recipe at some point, but this time, I made a coconut cream mousse instead.

**Ingredients:**  
6 tbsp butter or margarine  
1 cup packed brown sugar  
3 tbsp water  
1 (20oz) can pineapple slices, drained and halved  
2-2/3 cups all-purpose flour  
1-1/3 cup granulated sugar  
4 tsp baking powder  
1-1/3 cups milk  
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened  
2 eggs  
2 tsp vanilla  
1 pkg coconut cream instant pudding mix  
1-1/2 cups milk  
1-1/2 cups cool whip  
coconut (optional)

**Directions:**

  1. Blend together the coconut cream instant pudding mix along with the 1-1/2 cups milk.  Add in the cool whip and blend until thoroughly mixed.  Chill for 2-4 hours (but for best results, chill for 24 hours).
  2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  3. Melt 2 tbsp of butter or margarine in each of 2 &#8211; 9&#8243; round baking pans. Stir in 1/3 brown sugar and 1 tbsp water into each pan. Arrange pineapple in one pan, making sure you remember which pan has the pineapple in it. Set pans aside.
  4. In a medium mixing bowl, stir together flour, granulated sugar, and baking powder.  Add milk, the 1/2 cup butter or margarine, egg, and vanilla.  Beat with an electric mixer on low speed till combined.  Beat on medium speed for 1 minute.  Spoon batter evenly into the prepared pans.
  5. Bake in a oven for 30 to 35 minutes or til a wooden toothpick comes out clean.  Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes.  Loosen sides; invert the pan without the pineapples onto an empty plate.  Spread a layer of the coconut cream mousse across the top to desired thickness.  Sprinkle coconut across mousse for added texture.  Add second cake on top of the first, being careful not to smash the two together (otherwise you&#8217;ll have mousse oozing out).
  6. In a microwave bowl, heat 2 tbsp butter until melted.  Add 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1 tbsp water and mix.  Drizzle brown sugar mixture over cake.
