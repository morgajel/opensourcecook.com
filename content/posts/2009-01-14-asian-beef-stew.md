So this is what we had for dinner tonight &#8211; \*so good\*!!!!! Jay is typically very picky when it comes to beef stew (i have tried about 3 different times now i think) and he loved this! i made some notes at the bottom of what i did. It really was the perfect portion size. i have 1 serving, jay had 1.5 and there is enough left over for each of us to have it for lunch tomorrow. we will certainly make this again!

Today, I only used the following: 1 large onion, sliced, guessed on carrots, 1/2 cup of orange juice, guessed on peas

For the 1-1/2 cut/chopped potatoes, which I was suppose to boil them for 10ish minutes, I started that first, and let them boil for the duration of time while cutting/mixing the rest of the ingredients and added them last.

This was boarder line of hot (spicy) for me, but very tolerable. Jay \*loved\* it.Â  Said it was perfect (and he is very picky when it comes to beef stew).

2 tbsp hoisin sauce
