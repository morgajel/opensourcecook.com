A friend had made these recently for a party and she said they were a huge success, so I thought they would be great for Ian&#8217;s 2nd birthday party. They&#8217;ll be the perfect size for his little hands and the adults can enjoy them as well.  However, since I haven&#8217;t made them before, I tried them out for dinner tonight and I didn&#8217;t get what I was expecting.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the mini cheeseburgers (aka sliders) came out beautifully, but you really need to dice the onions finely and don&#8217;t add too many more.  I did what I normally do, not measure the onions, and I had added way to many for this recipe.  Granted, the recipe says to add 1 medium onion and I had half an onion to use, plus I was using 2 lbs of beef instead of 1-1/2, but it still came out way too oniony.  Plus, I didn&#8217;t dice them up fine enough.  Usually it doesn&#8217;t bother us if the onions are _finely_ chopped, but that made a difference this time around.

That&#8217;s another thing, I did change the amount of beef for this recipe.  I like it with 2 pounds of beef instead of 1-1/2.  With the way the beef shrinks when it&#8217;s cooked, the 2 pounds gave it more substance.  There was more to the sliders.  I&#8217;m almost tempted to double the cheese amount since I love cheese, but that&#8217;s a personal thing and honestly, what cheese was there was fine.

While this is technically an appetizer, you could also use this recipe for dinner to.  It&#8217;s something different than the normal cheeseburgers or meatloaf and it adds a little more pizazz to the table.  Plus, these burgers were the perfect size for Ian&#8217;s hands.  When I normally make cheeseburgers for dinner, I generally make a few &#8220;nugget sized&#8221; ones for Ian and have to figure out what to do about a bun.  With this, the buns are already figured out and he&#8217;s eating the same size as we are.

As of right now, I&#8217;m still planning on using this recipe for his birthday party on Saturday, but I&#8217;m going to have to double the recipe if I&#8217;m going to try and feed 15 people.  While I&#8217;m still going to have other food as well, there was four of us at dinner tonight and we ate 20 of the 24 sliders by ourselves.  I&#8217;m so going to need more for Saturday.

**Ingredients:**  
1 medium onion, about 1 cup finely chopped  
1/4 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped  
2 lb lean ground beef  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
1 tsp salt  
6 slices American cheese  
8 hot dog buns  
24 hamburger dill pickle slices (_optional_)

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Finely chop onion and parsley. Combine beef, onion, parsley, garlic and salt in a bowl; mix well. Press beef mixture evenly over bottom of a large bar pan. Bake 10-12 minutes or until beef is no longer pink.
  2. Meanwhile, cut cheese into quarters; set aside. Slice buns apart neatly at seams (do not separate tops from bottoms). Trim about 1/4 inch from each bun end to square off ends (discard trimmings). cut buns into thirds for a total of 24 square mini buns, set aside.
  3. Remove bar pan from oven. Pour off juices, if necessary, and place on a cooling rack. Cut beef mixture into 24 squares using a pizza cutter. Top each burger with one pickle and one piece of cheese. Place one bun top onto each burger; top with one bun bottom. Cover bar pan with aluminum foil and bake 3-5 minutes or until cheese is melted and buns are warm.
  4. To serve, place one burger with bun top onto one bun bottom using a mini spatula. Repeat with remaining burgers and bun bottoms. Serve immediately.
