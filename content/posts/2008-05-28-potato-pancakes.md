This time, I have two different versions of the same recipe, so I&#8217;m going to post them together.

Jesse and I tried the instant version, and while they were okay, they definitely need some work. They came off really bland and desperately in need of some flavoring. I&#8217;m thinking the chicken broth can go and be replaced with water and a bunch of spices. What those spices are, I&#8217;m not entirely sure yet, so I&#8217;m up for suggestions.

**INSTANT VERSION:**  
1 can (14 oz.) chicken broth (1 3/4 cups)  
Generous dash ground black pepper  
1-1/2 cups instant mashed potatoes flakes or buds  
1 green onion , coarsely chopped

**Directions:**

  1. HEAT broth and pepper in saucepan to a boil. Remove from heat. Add potato flakes and onion and stir until liquid is absorbed. Shape potato mixture into 4 (4&#8243;) pancakes.
  2. COOK pancakes in nonstick skillet until browned on both sides.

**FRESH VERSION:**  
2 lb. Idaho potatoes, peeled  
8 oz. yellow onions  
2 large eggs, beaten  
4 oz. ham, diced  
1/4 cup green onions, diced  
3 oz. green bell pepper, diced  
4 oz. cheddar cheese, shredded  
1/2 tsp. salt  
1/4 tsp. pepper  
Vegetable oil as needed  
Sour cream as needed

**Directions:**

  1. Rinse potatoes under cold water. Coarsely grate potatoes and onion using grater or food processor. Place in towel; twist to squeeze out all water.
  2. Mix potato and yellow onion with eggs, ham, green onions, bell peppers and cheese. Season with salt and pepper.
  3. Heat griddle or non-stick pan with thin film of vegetable oil over medium heat. Drop approximately 2 Tbsp. potato pancake mixture onto griddle and flatten with spatula. Fry until golden, flip over and brown other side, about 4 minutes. Drain on towel; serve immediately with sour cream.

For convenience, frozen hash browns can be substituted for the fresh IdahoÂ® Potatoes.
