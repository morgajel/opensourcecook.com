These are actually not that bad. They still taste like chocolate chip cookies, but they have white chocolate instead of semi-sweet. I did use wheat flour instead of white for a little difference. You really can&#8217;t tell it&#8217;s wheat flour, but you can tell there is something off about the cookie. It&#8217;s not a bad thing, but it does make it stand out a little more than just having the white chocolate. Overall, very good experiment.

**Ingredients:**  
3/4 cup sugar  
3/4 cup brown sugar  
1 cup softened butter or margainr  
1 tsp vanilla  
1 egg  
2 cups wheat flour  
1 tsp baking soda  
1/2 tsp salt  
2 cups white chocolate chips

**Directions:**

  1. Heat oven to 375ºF.
  2. Mix sugars, butter, vanilla and egg in large bowl. Stir in flour, baking soda and salt (dough will be stiff). Stir in chocolate chips. Drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls about 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheet.
  3. Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until light brown (centers will be soft). Cool slightly; remove from cookie sheet. Cool on wire rack.  (Total time will vary; cook or bake time is per batch.)

**Variation**  
Feeling a little nutty? Go ahead and add 1 cup coarsely chopped nuts with the chocolate chips.
