This is \*very\* good. The hubby and I love this recipe, however, we generally only make it for special occasions due to the price of flank steak. However, the red-wine sauce gives the steak a simply delicious flavor.

**Ingredients**  
1 Beef Flank Steak (about 1 pound)  
1/4 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper  
2 teaspoons olive oil  
1 large shallot, minced (about Â¼ cup)  
1/2 cup dry red wine  
1/2 cup chicken broth  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (or 2 teaspoons dried)

**Directions**

  1. Sprinkle steak on both sides with pepper. Heat nonstick 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add steak and cook about 14 minutes for medium rare or until desired doneness, turning once. Remove steak to cutting board; keep warm.
  2. To drippings in skillet, add olive oil, shallot and cook 2 minutes or until golden, stirring occasionally. Add red wine and chicken broth to skillet and heat to boiling. Cook 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in parsley. Add steak back to skillet and cook for another 5-10 minutes.

**To serve:** Holding knife almost parallel to cutting surface, thickly slice steak. Spoon red-wine sauce over steak slices.

**Makes:** 4 Servings
