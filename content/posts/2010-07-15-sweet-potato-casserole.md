Jesse really likes this recipe. It tends to be sweet, almost like a dessert, but doesn&#8217;t take away from the sweet potatoes. It is recommended that you use either 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar or vice versa.

**Ingredients:**  
2 large (about 2lbs) sweet potatoes  
1 cup sugar  
1/2 cup brown sugar  
1 stick (8 tbsp) softened butter or margarine  
4 large eggs  
1/2 cup buttermilk  
1/2 cup milk  
1/2 cup chopped pecans  
2 tsp vanilla  
1 tsp cinnamon  
1 tsp nutmeg

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Spray a 13&#215;9-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.
  2. Peel sweet potatoes and grate coarsely to yield 6 cups.
  3. Combine granulated sugar and butter in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer set at high speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each additions.
  4. Combine the sweet potatoes, buttermilk, milk, pecans, vanilla extract, cinnamon and nutmeg in a large bowl and mix well. Add butter mixture to sweet potato mixture and mix well.
  5. Spoon the sweet potato mixture into prepared baking dish. Bake for 1 1/4 hours. Serve Immediately.
