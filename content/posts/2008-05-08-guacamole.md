Jesse loves guacamole. Not only is it healthy, but it&#8217;s so quick and easy. The most strenuous task is cutting up the veggies that go into it, otherwise it&#8217;s all stirring and done in 5 minutes. I normally like to make it and refrigerate it for an hour (so the flavors and spices will blend), but Jesse doesn&#8217;t normally let it get that far. I barely get done stirring it before he&#8217;s dipping a chip into it.

Lately, he&#8217;s found another really great way to eat it. Meijers has been selling this artisan bread called &#8220;Black Bean & Salsa&#8221; and Jesse loves spreading guacamole on slices as if it was butter. He&#8217;ll eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner until the loaf is gone.

The amount of the onions, tomatoes, garlic, and jalapeÃ±os is up to you. I don&#8217;t usually measure them, but I do give a rough estimate in the ingredients. I will be honest, about the only thing I do measure is the lime juice and that&#8217;s because too much or too little makes a big difference.

**Ingredients:**  
2 large ripe pitted, peeled Avocados  
1 medium, finely chopped Roma tomatoes  
2 finely chopped JalapeÃ±os  
1/4 medium chopped Onion  
1-2 finely chopped Garlic Clove  
2 tbsp fresh Cilantro finely chopped (or to taste)  
2 tbsp Juice, lime  
1/2 tsp Salt  
dash Pepper, black  
dash Pepper, cayenne  
1 tsp Onion powder  
1 tsp Garlic powder

**Directions:**  
In a medium bowl, mash together the avocados, lime juice, and salt. Stir in cayenne pepper, cilantro and black pepper. Mix in onion, jalapeÃ±os, tomatoes, and garlic. Refrigerate 1 hour for best flavor, or serve immediately.
