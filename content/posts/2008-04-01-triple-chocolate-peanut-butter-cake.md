[<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3364/3334602566_51ea19b344_m.jpg" alt="dsc06880" width="240" height="180" />][1]I came up with this recipe when one of Jesse&#8217;s co-workers requested food and I found out he liked chocolate and peanut butter. That happens to be one of my all time favorite taste combinations. You want to make my day, give me something that has both chocolate and peanut butter and I will love you for the entire time it takes me to eat it.

I did come across one issues with this cake. Do not get the Super Moist cake from Betty Crocker. As it&#8217;s suppose to be, the cake is really moist and tends to be a pain to cut in half. Instead of getting two halves, I ended up with three pieces because the top half broke when I was separating the two.

While this may be one of my recipes, I did swipe the directions for the peanut butter filling. I took it from [Cupcake Bakeshop][2]. If you want the filling to be more stiff, than use less milk.

**Ingredients:**  
1 box Cake mix, triple chocolate  
1-1/2 container Frosting, triple chocolate  
1 (8oz) container Cream cheese  
2 cup Peanut butter, creamy  
4 cups Sugar, powdered  
1 tbsp Vanilla  
8 tbsp Milk

**Directions:**

  1. Prepare and bake cake according to box directions. Cool completely.
  2. Slice the cake through the middle to end up with two layers. Frost one layer with the peanut butter filling. Place the second layer on top of the peanut butter filling. Frost entire cake with triple chocolate frosting.
  3. Peanut Butter filling: Beat cream cheese and peanut butter until combined. Add powdered sugar and vanilla and beat until combined. Add the milk and beat until combined.
