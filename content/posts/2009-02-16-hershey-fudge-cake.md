This recipe came from my Grandma Birdie and while I haven&#8217;t tried it yet, I am trying to get all of my family recipes up on this site so I don&#8217;t lose them.  After all, it would be a shame if I ever did.

**Ingredients:**  
2-1/4 cups flour, sifted  
1 tsp baking soda  
1 tsp baking powder  
1/2 tsp salt  
2 eggs  
1/2 cup vegetable shortening  
1-1/2 cups sugar  
1 cup sour milk  
1/2 cup hot water  
1/2 cup cocoa  
1 tsp vanilla  
butter

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  2. Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together. Cream shortening and sugar; Add eggs – beating well. Mix cream mixture to flour mixture.
  3. Add flour mixture with sour milk. Mix cocoa and hot water to form paste. Cool.
  4. Add to cake butter. Bake for ½ hour or until done.
