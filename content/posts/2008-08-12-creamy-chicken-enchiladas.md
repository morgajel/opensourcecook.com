One of Jesse&#8217;s favorites. The fajita marinade can be substituted with any kind of seasoning desired. This is one I tend to make a lot and it&#8217;s actually really nice to make when you&#8217;re taking a dish to someone. I just found this out recently and it worked out really nice. Basically, I did all of the steps leading up to putting it in the oven for the 30 minutes. That way, when I took it over, all they had to do was bake it for 30 minutes and it was done. They still had a hot homemade dish and they didn&#8217;t have to prepare it at all.

I&#8217;ve made this a lot in the past too. This is one of those recipes that works really nice with the [Salsa][1] recipe and everyone seems to enjoy it.

**Ingredients:**  
1 pkg of Fajita Marinade Mix  
1/4 cup Water  
2 tbsp canola oil  
1 lb chicken breasts  
1 pkg of original country gravy mix  
2-1/4 cups milk  
1/2 cup [salsa][1]  
2 cups colby jack cheese  
6 (10in) burrito style flour tortillas  
1/4 cup green onions (optional)  
shredded lettuce (optional)  
tomatoes (optional)

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine Seasoning, water and oil in a self-closing plastic bag. Add cubed chicken. Close bag and turn to coat chicken. Refrigerate 15 minutes, or longer for stronger flavor.
  2. Prepare gravy according to package directions, except use 2 1/4 cups milk instead of water. Remove from heat; stir in salsa. Pour 1 cup gravy mixture into a 9&#215;13-inch baking dish. Set aside.
  3. In a large skillet add chicken and marinade. Saut√© over medium-high heat 7-8 minutes.
  4. Place 1/4 cup chicken in center of each tortilla. Top with 2 tablespoons of cheese. Fold over edges of tortilla and roll tightly. Arrange rolled tortillas in a single layer in prepared dish. Pour remaining gravy mixture over tortillas and top with remaining cheese. Bake 25-30 minutes or until heated through. Garnish with black olives and green onion. Serve with lettuce and tomato, if desired.
