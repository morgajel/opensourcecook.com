This recipe actually belongs to Jesse&#8217;s Aunt Terri and it&#8217;s one that his entire family loves. Terri usually makes it for Thanksgiving every year and I do have to say that it is tasty&#8230;.and rich. Jesse has been after me to try and make it for awhile now and with the Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake experiments, he wants me to use this recipe when I make it again (which, according to him, is going to be twice this week &#8211; once to see if I can do it and one more time after that). The first cheesecake came out pretty good, so hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to master this one as well.

One thing I was told was that I have to use Hellman&#8217;s real mayo, not Mircle Whip or any other kind. It has to be the Hellman&#8217;s since it&#8217;s actually mayo and not the lab generated stuff. Plus, it can&#8217;t be the light version either. The reasoning is the Hellman&#8217;s has actually eggs in it and all the others don&#8217;t.

**Ingredients:**  
16oz soft cream cheese  
1 cup mayo (real Hellman&#8217;s)  
1 cup sugar  
4 eggs  
2 cups chocolate chips melted  
2 tsp vanilla

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 F.
  2. Beat cheese and mayo at medium speed until smooth. Gradually beat in sugar. Beat in eggs one at a time. Beat in chocolate and vanilla until smooth. Pour into crust, place on a cookie sheet and bake at 350 F for 50 to 55 minutes.

  2. Mix all ingredients together and pour into spring form pan. Bake at 375 F for 8 minutes.
