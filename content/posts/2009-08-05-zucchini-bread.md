Seriously, I don&#8217;t have a zucchini bread recipe here?  Okay, I&#8217;m rectifying that now since I&#8217;m making a few loaves.  I love zucchini bread and I&#8217;m still trying to find a really good recipe.  I have my grandmother&#8217;s (which will be posted later), but Jesse is hooked on his moms (which I don&#8217;t have).  So I&#8217;m trying to find one that is mind.  What I have right now is the one from the Better Homes & Garden New Cookbook.  Although, I did add an extra 1/2 cup of zucchini shreddings since my grandmother&#8217;s called for 2 cups and this one only has 1. I also took out the nutmeg, which may or may not be a good thing. I&#8217;m not a fan of a lot of nutmeg, so I didn&#8217;t want it in there. The original recipe calls for 1/4 tsp. I also use a stone bread pan, so I had to lengthen the time they state in the recipe, so adjust as necessary.

**Ingredients:**  
1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour  
[<img decoding="async" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; width: 240px;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3496/3793107750_b1df6c0966_m.jpg" alt="" />][1]1 tsp ground cinnamon  
1/2 tsp baking soda  
1/4 tsp baking powder  
1/4 tsp salt  
1 cup sugar  
1 cup finely shredded zucchini  
1/4 cup cooking oil  
1 egg  
1/4 tsp finely shredded lemon peel  
1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease bottom and 1/2 inch up sides of an 8x4x2-inch loaf pan; set aside.
  2. In a medium mixing bowl combine the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder and salt (and nutmeg); set aside.
  3. In another medium mixing bowl combine sugar, shredded zucchini, cooking oil, egg and lemon peel; mix well. Add dry mixture to zucchini mixture. Stir just until moistened (batter should be lumpy). Fold in walnuts or pecans.
  4. Spoon batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 55 to 60 minutes or till a wooden toothpick inserted near center comes out clean. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove loaf from pan. Cool completely on the wire rack. Wrap and store overnight.
