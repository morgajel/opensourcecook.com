Since getting my snazzy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/USA-Pans-Pullman-Aluminized-Americoat/dp/B002UNMZPI?tag=literescap-20" target="_blank">new bread pan</a> from the in-laws at Christmas, I&#8217;ve been making a lot of bread.  Seriously, this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/USA-Pans-Pullman-Aluminized-Americoat/dp/B002UNMZPI?tag=literescap-20" target="_blank">pan</a> is awesome.  However, since I&#8217;ve only been using my bread machine to make the dough, I decided to play with my original <a href="/2008/10/24/60/chocolate-chip-bread" target="_blank">chocolate chip bread</a> recipe and came up with this one instead.

While I love the <a href="/2008/10/24/60/chocolate-chip-bread" target="_blank">chocolate chip bread</a> recipe, I wanted something that was more wheat bread and not so much sweet bread, but was still yummy enough that Jesse would approve.  So I took a [wheat bread recipe][1] I found that was really tasty and kind of merged it with the <a href="/2008/10/24/60/chocolate-chip-bread" target="_blank">chocolate chip bread</a> recipe.  I am pretty happy with the way it came out and Jesse totally approves (confirmed by the fact that he&#8217;ll eat the entire 13x4x4 loaf in one night if I let him).

1/4 cup honey  
1 cup warm water  
1/2 cup milk  
2 tbsp butter  
1 tsp salt  
1/4 cup special dark cocoa powder  
2-1/2 cup bread flour  
1-1/2 cup wheat flour  
2-1/4 tsp active dry yeast  
1 cup dark chocolate chips

**Directions**

  1. Using a bread machine, mix all the ingredients, except the chocolate chips, per the manufacturers directions.  Select Dough cycle; press Start.
  2. Once the dough is ready, place on a floured surface and knead in a third of the chocolate chips at a time.  Keep kneading until all the chocolate chips have been added and the dough is a dark chocolate color (the dough will look white due to the floured surface).
  3. Place dough into <a href="http://www.amazon.com/USA-Pans-Pullman-Aluminized-Americoat/dp/B002UNMZPI?tag=literescap-20" target="_blank">bread pan</a> and place in unheated oven for 30 minutes.
  4. After the 30 minutes has passed and the dough is still in the oven, heat your oven to 350 degrees F.  Bake for 30 minutes once the oven is preheated &#8211; ie if it takes 6 minutes to heat up, your timer should say 36 minutes.
  5. Remove from pan and cool.  Store the bread in a tightly sealed container.  The loaf fits in this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Heritage-Mint-HPL849P-Storage-Container/dp/B001E95JBQ?tag=literescap-20" target="_blank">21 Cup Bread Container</a> perfectly.

**Serving Size:** One 13x4x4 loaf

**Variation:** The hubby loves dark chocolate, but any chocolate chip/cocoa powder combination can be used.
