For these, we ended up changing the amount of cinnamon for the coating simply because I thought it was a little too powerful. I like cinnamon, but it was a little strong and it overpowered the sugar it was mixed with. I liked the idea of a more cinnamony sugar taste than straight cinnamon, but this can be changed depending on one&#8217;s preferences.
