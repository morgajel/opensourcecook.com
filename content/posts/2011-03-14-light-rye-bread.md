Yeah, I&#8217;m not a rye bread fan, but the hubby is so here&#8217;s another recipe from my mother-in-law.

_1 pound loaf_  
3/4 cup Water  
2 tsp Cornmeal  
1-1/2 cups White Bread Flour  
2 tsp Caraway Seeds  
1/2 cup Rye Flour  
1/2 tbsp Gluten  
1-1/2 tbsp Sugar  
1-1/4 tsp Fast Rise Yeast or 2 tsp Active Dry Yeast  
3/4 tsp Salt  
3/4 tbsp Butter

_1-1/2 to 2 pound loaf_  
1 cup + 2 tbsp Water  
1 tbsp Cornmeal  
2-1/4 cups White Bread Flour  
1 tbsp Caraway Seeds  
3/4 cup Rye Flour  
1 tbsp Gluten  
2-1/2 tbsp Sugar  
2 tsp Fast Rise Yeast or 3 tsp Active Dry Yeast  
1-1/4 tsp Salt  
1-1/4 tbsp Butter

Let rise 1 hour. Bake at 350 degrees for 35-40 minutes for a 1lb loaf or 40-45 minutes for a 1.5-2lb loaf. Remove from pan and cool.  Store the bread in a tightly sealed container.  The loaf fits in this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Heritage-Mint-HPL849P-Storage-Container/dp/B001E95JBQ?tag=literescap-20" target="_blank">21 cup bread container</a> perfectly.
