This is a great addition to many meals!

**Ingredients**  
4 Large baking potatoes  
1/4 tsp salt  
1/4 tsp pepper

**Directions**

  1. Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Spray two large cookie sheets with nonstick cooking spray.
  2. Scrub four (4) medium unpeeled baking potatoes (2 pounds) well, but do not peel. Cut each potato lengthwise into Â¼ inch think slices, then cut each slice lengthwise into 1/4 inch wide sticks. Place potatoes in medium bowl and toss with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Divide potato sticks equally between pans.
  3. Place pans on two oven racks and bake potatoes 20 to 25 minutes, until tender and browned, turning potatoes once and rotating pans between upper and lower racks halfway through the baking time.
