A feature I am going to try to do each week (or month, we&#8217;ll see how it goes) is going to be a &#8220;featured product&#8221;. Something I&#8217;ve used and love and think others will as well.

For the first installment, this weeks featured product is the Cut-N-Seal. I wasn&#8217;t initially interested in this item until I saw a post where it was featured at a show that consisted primarily of mom&#8217;s. The reason it was spotlighted &#8211; crustless sandwiches. How many moms have kids who won&#8217;t eat a sandwich with the crust on it? This is actually perfect for that mom.

The Cut-N-Seal takes a new twist on the pocket sandwich by not only cutting away all of the crust with one motion, but it also seals in all the contents of the sandwich. I just made a PB&J sandwich for my son and it was beautiful. He not only ate all of it, but the clean up was minimal compared to any other time he has had a PB&J.

I&#8217;ve also been playing around with the idea of making my own ravioli and this seems like the perfect tool to help me do it. I&#8217;m still playing with it, but from what I&#8217;ve seen, it&#8217;s going to be an awesome item to have in my kitchen.
