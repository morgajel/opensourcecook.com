We&#8217;re huge fans of fresh bread and ever sine our bread machine committed suicide, we haven&#8217;t had any in the house.  Jesse recently got a craving for it and found this [Easy Bread recipe][1] by Marcia Passos Duffy via the [The Heart of New England][2].

I was kind of skeptical at first, but it really is a simple recipe to make.  I can handle 8 minutes of kneading and other than mixing the ingredients, there really isn&#8217;t that much more to it.  The taste was really good to.  I do think I made a mistake when I was forming the loaves, but that&#8217;s only because of the &#8220;cut&#8221; they want you to do to the top.  Other than that, it was really good. We already have plans of using it as a base recipe for a few different types of breads we want to try.

**Ingredients**  
5-6 cups all-purpose flour (you can substitute whole wheat flour for 1 or 2  
cups).  
2 tbsp of dry yeast  
2 tbsp brown sugar  
1 tbsp salt  
2 cups hot water (120-130 degrees F.)  
A cake pan of hot water (used for humidity)

**Directions:**

  1. Mix 3 cups of the flour with the yeast, sugar and salt.  Pour in the hot water and beat 100 strokes (or 3 minutes with a mixer).
  2. Stir in the remaining flour until the dough loses its stickiness.  Turn onto a floured surface. Knead for 8 minutes.
  3. Place dough in a greased bowl and cover with a warm damp cloth.  Let rise for 15 minutes in a warm spot (away from drafts).
  4. Punch down and divide the dough into two pieces.  Shape into round loaves and place on a greased baking sheet.  Cut an &#8220;X&#8221; one-half inch deep in each of the loaves with a wet sharp knife.
  5. Place baking sheet with loaves in the middle of a COLD oven. Place a pan of hot water on the lowest shelf.  Heat the oven to 400 degrees and bake 40-50 minutes until golden brown.
