The only thing I would do different would be to make the meatballs a little smaller. They came out really big and while that wasn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing, it did make it a little hard to include them with the spaghetti sauce.

**Ingredients:**  
1/4 cup Parmesan Cheese  
1 tbsp finely chopped Onions  
1/2 cup Breadcrumbs  
Salt  
Pepper, black  
Garlic  
1.5 lbs Hamburger  
Tomato sauce

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  2. Mix all ingredients together. Add water if needed. Mixture should be moist but not so that the meatballs fall apart.
  3. Shape meatballs to desired size and place in a 8&#215;8 pan. Bake for 30 minutes. When finished, add to spaghetti sauce and simmer at least 20 minutes.
