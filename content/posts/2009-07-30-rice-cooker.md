This is my new favorite tool to have in the kitchen and for all the wrong reasons!  Have you ever had one of those cravings late at night and could do nothing about it?  You know the ones, where you want a big slice of chocolate cake (or any kind)?  I know I have and not getting that slice usually meant I had cake on my mind all night.  At 10 o&#8217;clock at night, who wants to wait around for an hour and a half for a cake to bake and get frosted just to satisfy a craving?  The rice cooker is the perfect tool to help with that craving.  I was able [to bake, and frost, a cake][1] in 10 minutes flat.  Now that I would have no problem doing at 10 o&#8217;clock at night.

Granted, that&#8217;s part of the reason it&#8217;s so wrong.  I know I don&#8217;t **need** to have that cake at night, and usually the time to make it deters me enough not to have it, but now I have to rely on my will power.

On the flip side, using the rice cooker to make a cake has some other benefits.  How many of us have kids who have wanted to bake a cake for some reason?  To bake a cake in the oven, an adult has to be around &#8211; there&#8217;s no question about it.  However, with the rice cooker, there is no use for the oven. The cake is made in the microwave and most kids can handle that on their own.

Also, how many of us know bachelors?
