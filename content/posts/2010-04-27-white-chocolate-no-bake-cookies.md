I don&#8217;t know why I haven&#8217;t thought of this before, but instead of finding a white chocolate no bake recipe, I&#8217;m just revamping this one.  Instead of adding the cocoa, I&#8217;m throwing in a couple of ounces of white chocolate instead.  With the first batch, I only threw in 4oz and they didn&#8217;t come out as white chocolaty as I would have liked.  They were more peanut butter flavored than anything.  So I&#8217;m doubling the white chocolate required.  Granted, I haven&#8217;t tried it with 8oz yet, but I&#8217;m not one who&#8217;s afraid of too much chocolate, regardless the type.  I&#8217;ll get a picture added once I find the correct amount of white chocolate.

**Ingredients:**  
2 cups Sugar  
1/4 tsp Salt  
1/2 cup Milk  
1/2 cup Butter or Margarine  
8oz White Chocolate  
1/2 cup Peanut butter  
1/2 tsp Vanilla  
3 cups old fashion Oats, quick cooking (or 4 cups instant)  
8 oz pkg Peanuts (optional)

**Directions:**  
Combine sugar, salt, milk, butter and cocoa in saucepan and bring to a boil. Boil for 2 minutes. Mix peanut butter, vanilla, oatmeal and peanuts. Drop onto table &#8211; spoon onto wax paper. Cool.
