I&#8217;ve really been in the mood for chicken and rice soup, so when I found this really great [Easy Chicken and Rice Soup][1] recipe over at Two Peas and Their Pod, I just had to try it.  Now, I&#8217;m more of a quick and easy cook rather than all the little techniques, so I did make a few changes to the recipe.

The changes I made shouldn&#8217;t be too problematic &#8211; in fact I think they worked beautifully.  The first difference is with the chicken.  I wanted something that was a little more last minute, and since I always forget to take chicken out from the freezer, I substituted canned chicken for the shredded chicken.  Now honestly, I didn&#8217;t seeing a big difference between the two and the canned allowed me to make this quicker.   I also have this thing about measuring spices when it comes to soups.  I do a lot of &#8220;add of little of this, a little more&#8221; with a lot of the seasoning since you can generally tell when something is off once it starts getting warm.  You know you&#8217;re doing something right when the house smells good.  \*grin\*

Aside from the substitutions, I also added a few things.  Jesse and I have been playing around with a dehydrator lately, so we had a bunch of dried vegetables in the house and I wanted to use some of them.  So instead of the fresh onion the original recipe calls for, I switched out some dried purple onions (I can&#8217;t think of their name right now) and also added in some dried green pepper.  Since I wasn&#8217;t sure how they would cook, I did diced them up into a nice seasoning powder, but I have to say I love the addition.

**Ingredients:**  
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
2 medium carrots, sliced or diced (your preference)  
2 celery ribs, halved lengthwise, and sliced or diced (your preference)  
dried thyme  
dried green pepper  
dried purple onion, diced  
1 bay leaf  
8 buillon cubes  
5 cups water  
2 quarts chicken stock or broth (we use low sodium)  
1 cup long grain white rice  
3 (12.5oz) cans of chicken (with rib meat in water)  
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

**Directions:**

Place a soup pot over medium heat and add the olive oil. Add the onion, garlic, carrots, celery, thyme and bay leaf. Cook and stir for about 6 minutes, until the vegetables are softened but not browned. Pour in the chicken broth and water- bring the liquid to a boil. Add in the rice and chicken; season with salt and pepper. Cook on medium-low until the rice is tender-about 30 minutes. Serve hot.

\*Note-for the shredded chicken I used 2 large chicken breasts. I boiled a pot of water on the stove and added in the chicken-which I cut into large pieces. Boil the chicken until it is cooked all the way through and there is no pink left. This will take about 7 minutes or so. Drain the water and shred the chicken once it is cooled. I use 2 forks to shred the chicken. \*
