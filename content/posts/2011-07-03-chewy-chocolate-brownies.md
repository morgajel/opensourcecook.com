The boys love their brownies, so I have a feeling I&#8217;ll be trying a couple of different recipes until I find one that works.Â  The first one is from _[Great Gluten-Free Baking][1]_ by Louise Blair, and aside from the different flours, there&#8217;s not a whole lot that shouldn&#8217;t make this work.

**Ingredients:**  
3oz gluten-free dark sweet chocolate  
7 tbsp butter  
1 cup packed light brown sugar  
2 eggs, beaten  
few drops of vanilla extract  
1/2 cup ground almonds  
2 tbsp plus 1.5 tsp brown rice flour  
1 cup mixed nuts, toasted and roughly chopped (optional)

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and line an 11&#215;7 inch baking pan. Place the chocolate and butter in a large heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water and melt. Stir in all the remaining ingredients and combine well.
  2. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and place in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, until slightly springy in the center. Remove from the oven and cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then mark to divide into 15 squares.
