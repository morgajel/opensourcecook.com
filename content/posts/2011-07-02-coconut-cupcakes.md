Now that Simon has the wheat-allergy, you&#8217;re going to be seeing more gluten-free and wheat-free recipes showing up.  The more I read up on this allergy, the more restrictive I realize his diet is going to be.  Therefore, I&#8217;m turning the entire house into a wheat-free zone and that means all of us are going on this diet.  This also means I really need to find adequate substitutes for some of our favorites otherwise Ian and Jesse may start a mutiny. \*grin\*  So Coconut Cupcakes, from _[Great Gluten-Free Baking][1]_ by Louise Blair,  will be the first of many recipes to be gluten or wheat free.  Right now, I&#8217;m simply gathering recipes, so I&#8217;ll add comments once I actually try it, but these sound good and quite easy to make.

**Ingredients:**  
12 tbsp butter, softened  
3/4 cup granulated sugar  
few drops vanilla extract  
3 eggs, beaten  
3/4 cup brown rice flour  
3/4 cup corn flour  
2 tsp gluten-free baking powder  
1/2 cup shredded coconut, soaked in 1/2 cup boiling water

_topping:_  
4 tbsp butter, softened  
1 cup confectioners&#8217; sugar  
2 tbsp shredded coconut, toasted

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-hole muffin pan with paper liners. Place all the cake ingredients in a food processor and whiz until smooth, or beat together in a large bowl.
  2. Spoon the mixture into the paper liners and place in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, until golden and risen. Remove the cakes from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool.
  3. Place the butter and confectioners&#8217; sugar in a bowl and beat together until pale and creamy, then stir in the toasted coconut. Spread a little frosting on each cake.
