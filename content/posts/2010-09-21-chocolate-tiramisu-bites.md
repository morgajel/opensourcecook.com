On the cover of the latest edition of the Pampered Chef Best Season&#8217;s Recipe Collection are these mini chocolate tiramisu cakes and they looked really good.  So I had to attempt them, but I&#8217;m not calling mine &#8220;mini cakes&#8221;.  They are very much bite-sized and easily consumable if you&#8217;re not careful.  \*grin\*

I generally don&#8217;t like adjusting measurements when I first attempt a recipe, but this time I did.  The original recipe calls for one tablespoon of water, but while I was mixing the batter, it was so thick and uncooperative, that I added two more tablespoons.  Even after adding the additional water, it was still a little thick, but I don&#8217;t think it messed up the recipe at all.  In fact, I would almost suggest adding a little more water to make it easier to scoop the batter into the muffin cups.

Speaking of the muffin cups, if you don&#8217;t have a small scoop, I highly suggest you get one.  With how thick the batter is, the scoop made it a lot easier to make sure each cup had close to the same amount.  I don&#8217;t even want to imagine trying to use two spoons to do the same thing.

The coffee taste was a little strong for me, but then again, I&#8217;m not a huge coffee lover either.  However, Jesse is and even he said that the granules needed to be grounded finely.  Otherwise, the taste of coffee in the cakes were pretty good.

I did mess up one thing&#8230;I added the whipped cream to the cream cheese mixture and I totally wasn&#8217;t suppose to do that.  Personally, I don&#8217;t think it changed the end result at all, in fact I liked it, but it did mean that there wasn&#8217;t the dual colors on top.

One other thing I didn&#8217;t do was use the coffee liqueur.  I&#8217;m not sure if that changed the flavor a lot or not, but I didn&#8217;t miss it.  Honestly, since neither of us really drink, I didn&#8217;t have any in the house and while there is a work around for it (down below), I simply forgot about it.

Also, the recipe says it makes 24 bite-sized cakes, but I ended up with 3 dozen using the small scoop.  You know what, something else I just noticed is that in the Cook&#8217;s Tips, it only shows to use 1-2/3 cups of the cake mix from a 18.25oz package.  That may be why my batter was so thick&#8230;I had a lot more than 9oz of cake mix.  Mmmm&#8230;.I didn&#8217;t even think to check the size of the cake mix box, I mean, it wouldn&#8217;t have dawned on me that there were various sizes.

1 (9oz) pkg of devil&#8217;s food cake mix  
1/4 cup sour cream  
1 egg  
1 tbsp instant coffee granules

1/3 cup coffee liqueur  
1-1/2 cups whipped topping  
8oz mascarpone or cream cheese  
1/4 cup powdered sugar  
2 tsp vanilla extract

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray cups of a mini-muffin pan with nonstick cooking spray.  For cakes, combine cake mix, sour cream, egg, coffee granules and water in bowl; mix well.  Place 1 tbsp of batter into each muffin cup.  Bake 8 &#8211; 10 minutes or until wooden pick inserted in centers comes out clean.
  2. Meanwhile, place whipped topping into large resealable plastic bag; secure and set aside.  For filling, combine cheese, sugar and vanilla in clean bowl; mix until smooth using clean scraper.  Place filling into an additional resealable plastic bag; secure and set aside.
  3. Remove pan from oven to cooling rack. Press tops of cakes with lightly floured mini-tart shaper to make slight indentations; cool 2 minutes.  Remove cakes from pan to cooling rack.  Brush tops with coffee liqueur using a basting brush; cool completely.
  4. Trim corners of both bags.  Pipe folling over cakes.  Pipe whipped topping over filling.  Sprinkle with cocoa powder, if desired.
