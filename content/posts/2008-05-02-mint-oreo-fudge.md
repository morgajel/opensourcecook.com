I can&#8217;t believe I haven&#8217;t posted this one before. I came up with this while we were still out in Washington DC and I&#8217;m still trying to prefect it. Actually, I&#8217;m still trying to make fudge correctly. It crystallizes on me to quickly. I&#8217;ll get the hang of it eventually, but even though the fudge doesn&#8217;t turn out right, the taste is still awesome! I love me some mint and oreos and this fudge is still good (as long as the crystals aren&#8217;t too bad). This recipe was a pain in the butt to make, but it was so good once it was done. I&#8217;m still trying to perfect the recipe, so if anyone has any good ideas, I&#8217;m so open to them.

I prefer to use the double-stuffed oreos, but any kind of oreos should work. I also recommend using a wooden spatula or fork to crush the oreos.

Servings/Makes: 36 pieces or 1-3/4 pounds

<span style="font-weight: bold">Ingredients:</span>  
3 cups &#8211; Sugar  
2/3 cup &#8211; Cocoa  
1/8 tsp &#8211; Salt  
1-2/3 cups &#8211; Milk  
1/4 cup &#8211; Butter or Margarine  
1 tsp &#8211; Vanilla  
1 tsp &#8211; Peppermint extract  
24 &#8211; Cookies, oreos crushed

<span style="font-weight: bold">Directions:</span>

  1. Line 8-or 9-inch square pan with foil, extending foil over edges of pan. Butter foil.
  2. Mix sugar, cocoa and salt in heavy 4-quart saucepan; stir in milk. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to full rolling boil. Boil, without stirring, until mixture reaches 234 degrees F on candy thermometer or until small amount of mixture dropped into very cold water, forms a soft ball which flattens when removed from water. (Bulb of candy thermometer should not rest on bottom of saucepan.)
  3. Remove from heat. Add butter, vanilla, and mint. DO NOT STIR. Cool at room temperature to 110 degree F (lukewarm). Mix in oreos. Beat with wooden spoon until fudge thickens and just begins to lose some of its gloss. Do not over stir. Quickly spread into prepared pan; cool completely. Cut into squares. Store in tightly covered container at room temperature.
