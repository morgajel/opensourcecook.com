Since I have the treats for the kids for our Mom&#8217;s Group on Thursday, I now needed something for the mamas. I&#8217;m in a fruit craving mode and some of the other moms wanted healthy (or something that wouldn&#8217;t ruin their diets), so I was looking for a recipe that combined the two. I had completely forgotten that I had bought this Jell-O/Cool Whip recipe book at the grocery store awhile ago and when I started flipping through it again, I came across the recipe for [_Berried Delight_][1] and thought success!  It has the fruit for me and I could so easily make it diet friendly.

So I did change up all the ingredients to either fat free or &#8220;light&#8221; whenever I could, which was pretty much everything.  I did also use frozen strawberries since they are out of season right now and I&#8217;m hoping that works alright.  I actually like using the frozen strawberries because they were easier to cut with my egg slicer and they were easier to place on top of the mixture.  Now I did find out that if you let them thaw (or defrost them) too much, then it&#8217;s not a good thing.  However, using the egg slicer to cut the strawberries was a smart move on my part.

I did change one thing up&#8230;I doubled the amount of graham cracker crust.  I like the cracker crust, so I wanted to make sure there was plenty there.  If you&#8217;re one who doesn&#8217;t like it, then you can halve my measurements to get back to the original amount.

Overall, this was really easy to assemble and I can&#8217;t wait to see what it tastes like tomorrow.

_It&#8217;s Tomorrow_: and I didn&#8217;t get a chance to try this since Ian and I had to bail out on our group today. However, I did get to send this in (Thanks Roz for picking it up!), so I&#8217;m posting this without any further comments from me.  Hopefully those who did make it today can let me know how it tasted.  It looked good, I will say that.
