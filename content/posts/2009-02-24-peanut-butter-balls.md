I am totally shocked that I haven&#8217;t posted this recipe yet. It comes from my Aunt Joann and it is fabulous. It is one of my all time favorite holiday recipes (which seems to be the only time anyone wants to make them) and combines two of my all time favorite ingredients &#8211; chocolate and peanut butter.

We actually did try and make these when we did our holiday baking last season, but for some reason they didn&#8217;t come out right. Now that I know I have the recipe, I am so going to try these again.

**Ingredients:**  
2 pound confectioner sugar  
1 pound peanut butter  
1 pound oleo  
2 cups chocolate chips  
1 1/3 stick paraffin

**Directions:**  
Knead together sugar, peanut butter and oleo. Form into 1 inch balls. Chill 1 hour.  
Melt chocolate and paraffin over boiling water. Dip balls with toothpick into chocolate. Place on waxed paper.
