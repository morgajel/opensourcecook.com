This one is a new recipe for me. Strawberry Walnut Bread is actually not too bad, but it does need some work.  For one thing, the directions say to thaw the frozen strawberries and then fold them into the batter.  Well, unless you can find some diced strawberries in the freezer section, you will need to chop them up.  I had actually cut them in half and used an electric mixer to add them to the batter, which blended a lot of them up, but not all of them, and it still turned out kind of wet.  The batter itself was great and passed the toothpick test, but the individual strawberries that survived the mixer ended up mushy.  I&#8217;m not a real fan of mushy strawberries (and neither is Jesse) so next time I&#8217;m thinking of blending them first and then adding them to the batter or maybe finding some other form of strawberry to add.  Maybe a organic strawberry jam or something.  I&#8217;ll have to think on it.

Overall, the bread wasn&#8217;t a complete bust, just need some changes here and there.

**Ingredients:**  
3 cups Flour, all-purpose  
2 cups Sugar  
1 tbsp Cinnamon  
1-1/2 tsp Baking soda  
1 tsp Salt  
4 large Eggs  
1-1/4 cup Oil, vegetable  
1-1/4 cup chopped Walnuts  
1 (10oz) pkg frozen Strawberries sliced sweetened, thawed

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour two 9&#215;5 inch loaf pans.
  2. Combine flour, granulated sugar, cinnamon, baking soda and salt in a large bowl and mix well.
  3. Whisk eggs in a small bowl until blended. Add the eggs and oil to the flour mixture and stir just until blended. Fold in undrained strawberries and walnuts.
  4. Spoon equal portions of the batter into the prepared loaf pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted in centers of loaves comes out clean, about 70 minutes.
  5. Cool loaves in pans for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
