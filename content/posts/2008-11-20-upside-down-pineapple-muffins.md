Now the idea of an upside down pineapple muffin may raise a few eyebrows.  You can&#8217;t make the muffins exactly like the cake, otherwise you would end up with some messy muffin bottoms (which I almost did and thankfully remembered in time).  The trick is to remember that the pineapple topping is suppose to be on top and not the bottom.

I fixed this problem the easiest way I could.  Instead of putting the topping in the bottom of the pan, thus before the batter, I changed the sequence around.  I sprayed the muffin pan with cooking spray and then added the batter.  Then, I mixed the brown sugar and pineapple together and put a spoonful on top of each muffin; and then baked it.  The idea was that the muffins would come out like the cake.

As it turns out, what I wanted and what happened were two different things.  While having the pineapple mixture on top did work, Jesse made the comment that if you bite into a part that didn&#8217;t have any of the pineapple on it, then it was kind of bland in comparison.  He made sure to say that it wasn&#8217;t bad, but it didn&#8217;t have that same&#8230;something&#8230;that the bites with pineapple had.  Does that make sense?  So I just throw the rest of the pineapple mixture into the batter and made the muffins that way.  There&#8217;ll still be that upside down pineapple taste, but they&#8217;ll just be a little simpler than the cake.

**Ingredients:**  
1/2 cup packed brown sugar  
1 tbsp water  
1 (20oz) can crushed pineapple, drained  
2-2/3 cups all-purpose flour  
1-1/3 cup granulated sugar  
4 tsp baking powder  
1-1/3 cups milk  
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened  
2 eggs  
2 tsp vanilla

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  2. In a medium mixing bowl, stir together flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar and baking powder.  Add milk, the 1/2 cup butter or margarine, egg, pineapple (for an added taste, you can include a little of the pineapple juice to the batter, but I wouldn&#8217;t add more than 2-3 tbsp), and vanilla.  Beat with an electric mixer on low speed till combined.  Beat on medium speed for 1 minute.  Spoon batter evenly into prepared muffin pans.
  3. Bake in a oven for 25 minutes or til a wooden toothpick comes out clean.  Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes.
