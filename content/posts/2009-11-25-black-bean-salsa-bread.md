Since we tried the [Easy Bread recipe][1] by Marcia Passos Duffy via the [The Heart of New England][2] and it was really good, we figured we could make a couple of specialty breads with it.  So here&#8217;s our attempt at Black Bean Salsa bread.  It still needs a little work (we&#8217;re thinking it needs some cayenne pepper to give it more of a kick), but Jesse is really enjoying it.

_Updated 11/27_: I&#8217;m still working on this recipe.  This time around, instead of mashing all of the black beans, what I did instead was place half of them in a blender along with the tomatoes, onions, jalapeños and 2 cups of hot water for less than a minute.  I didn&#8217;t want to puree anything, just finely chopped the tomatoes a little more and it made smashing the beans a little easier.  This also gave them this nice tiny bites that should help color the bread a little.  I&#8217;ve also added the cayenne and black pepper to the recipe.  Jesse&#8217;s biggest complaint on the first attempt was that it wasn&#8217;t spicy enough, so I&#8217;m trying to fix that.  One other thing I&#8217;m trying is using a bread machine (we finally got a new one) to make up the dough and then I&#8217;ll bake it in the oven.  I&#8217;ll add my bread machine directions below.

**Ingredients**  
1/2 (6.5oz) jar of sun-dried tomatoes, drained and diced  
1/2 a can of black beans, drained  
1/2 small onion  
1 tbsp diced jalapeños  
2 cups hot water (120-130 degrees F.)  
1 garlic clove, minced  
1 tsp onion powder  
1 tsp garlic powder  
dash of cumin  
1 tsp of cayenne pepper  
5-6 cups all-purpose flour (you can substitute whole wheat flour for 1 or 2 cups).  
2 tbsp brown sugar  
1 tbsp salt  
dash coarsely ground black pepper  
2 tbsp of dry yeast  
A cake pan of hot water (used for humidity)

**Directions:**

  1. Mix 3 cups of the flour with the yeast, sugar, onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, cayenne pepper and salt.  Pour in the hot water and beat 100 strokes (or 3 minutes with a mixer).
  2. Take 1/2 of the black beans and smash with a potato smasher (or some other method). Mix together smashed black beans, whole black beans, tomatoes, onion, jalapeños and minced garlic.  Add to flour mixture and mix well.
  3. Stir in the remaining flour until the dough loses its stickiness.  Turn onto a floured surface. Knead for 8 minutes.
  4. Place dough in a greased bowl and cover with a warm damp cloth.  Let rise for 15 minutes in a warm spot (away from drafts).
  5. Punch down and divide the dough into two pieces.  Shape into round loaves and place on a greased baking sheet.  Cut an &#8220;X&#8221; one-half inch deep in each of the loaves with a wet sharp knife.
  6. Place baking sheet with loaves in the middle of a COLD oven. Place a pan of hot water on the lowest shelf.  Heat the oven to 400 degrees and bake 40-50 minutes until golden brown.

**Bread Machine Directions:**

  1. Add 1/2 of the black beans, tomatoes, onions, jalapeños and 2 cups of water (although if you can finely dice the onions and jalapeños, you don&#8217;t have to blend them) to a blender.  Blend for less than 1 minute, just enough to do a good dice.  Add to bread machine pan.
  2. Add all the dry ingredients to the bread machine pan, on top of the wet mixture.
  3. On the bread machine, select the dough setting and press start.
  4. Place dough in a greased bowl and cover with a warm damp cloth.  Let rise for 15 minutes in a warm spot (away from drafts).
  5. Punch down and divide the dough into two pieces.  Shape into round loaves and place on a greased baking sheet.  Cut an &#8220;X&#8221; one-half inch deep in each of the loaves with a wet sharp knife.
  6. Place baking sheet with loaves in the middle of a COLD oven. Place a pan of hot water on the lowest shelf.  Heat the oven to 400 degrees and bake 40-50 minutes until golden brown.
