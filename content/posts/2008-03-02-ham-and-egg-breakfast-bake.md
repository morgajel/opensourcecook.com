This came out really good. Even though I&#8217;m not a big fan of green peppers, they were really good in this recipe. I diced them finely, so you could still taste them, but you never really bitE into one. I prepared this last night and I baked it this morning&#8230;it was so easy. Plus, I can do so many variations to this. Instead of ham, I could use sausage. I could do a vegetarian and not include any meat. Or i could add different kinds of veggies and meat. This is one I&#8217;m definitely going to make again.

I took the base of this recipe from Betty Crocker, but I added and changed a few things and I think it came out better with the changes.

_Edit on 3/23_: My father tried this for Easter weekend, however he made two different versions. My sister doesn&#8217;t like green peppers, and he was making a ham to go along with it, so he didn&#8217;t add any meat to either batch and he left out the veggies in one of them. I have to say, without the meat and veggies, you **_need_** to cut back the liquid.

Edit on 4/26_: I tried this recipe with maple flavored sausage and I think it would have came out good if I hadn&#8217;t also used southwestern flavored hash browns. Needless to say, the two flavors together didn&#8217;t work out well. Using different flavored hash browns is good, but you need to make sure the meat doesn&#8217;t clash with it. I&#8217;m hoping to try this recipe with sausage again, but with the correct hash browns.

**Ingredients:**  
1 cup cooked, diced Ham  
1 pkg Hash Browns (Betty Crocker Seasoned)  
Green Bell Pepper  
Onions  
2 cups shredded (8oz) Cheddar Cheese  
1 cup Bisquick  
3 cups Milk  
1/2 tsp Pepper, black  
4 Eggs (or 1 cup egg product)

**Directions:**

  1. Heat oven to 375ÂºF. Grease rectangular baking dish, 13x9x2 inches.
  2. Layer ham, potatoes, bell pepper, onion and 1 cup of the cheese in baking dish. Stir Bisquick mix, milk, pepper and eggs until blended. Pour into baking dish; sprinkle with remaining cheese. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours but no longer than 24 hours.
  3. Bake uncovered 30 to 35 minutes or until light golden brown around edges and cheese is melted. Let stand 10 minutes.
