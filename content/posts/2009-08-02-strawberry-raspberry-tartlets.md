This was actually really easy to make except I think I added a little too much berry filling when I made it. The tart was a little too heavy and the bottom center never really cooked thoroughly. I also changed up the filling a bit so I wasn&#8217;t exactly following the directions. Instead of using cherry pie filling and fresh strawberries, I used strawberry pie filling and fresh raspberry and blueberries. The flavor was good, but I think I added too many berries. So this is one that can definitely be fiddled with, in regards to the fruit center, but definitely keep an eye on how much of the fresh fruit you add.

**Ingredients:**  
2 pkg (15oz) refrigerated pie crusts, softened as directed on package  
1 cup almonds, sliced  
4 tbsp sugar  
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon  
1 cup strawberries, hulled and sliced  
1 can (21oz) raspberry pie filling

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Gently unroll one pie crust onto lightly floured Cutting Board. Spacing closely together, cut 12 disks from crust using outer tube of Measure-All Cup (nine around outside edge and three in center). Press disks into wells of Deluxe Mini-Muffin Pan using Mini-Tart Shaper, ruffling edges. Repeat with remaining crust.
  2. Using the Egg Slicer Plus, slice thawed strawberries. In Classic Batter Bowl, combine and mix strawberries and raspberry pie filling. Cut remaining pie crust into pieces using Crinkle Cutter (it is not necessary to unfold crust). In the Small Batter Bowl, mix together the almonds, sugar, pie crust pieces and cinnamon; mix well. Add crust mixture to the berry mixture and mix well.
  3. Spoon berry filling evenly into tart shells using the Small Scoop. Bake 14-16 minutes or until edges of tartlets are golden brown. Remove tartlets from pan to Stackable Cooling Rack. Serve warm.

**Yields:** 24 servings
