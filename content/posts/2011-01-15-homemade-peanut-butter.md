With how much I use peanut butter, I never once thought about making my own until I came across this recipe. Now, I don&#8217;t have a food processor, so I haven&#8217;t tried it yet, but I wanted to add it to my collection so when I do get one, I can try it.

I found the recipe over on [Disney Family][1] and they have quite a few really good recipes to check out.

**Hands-On Time:** 5 minutes  
**Yield:** 1 pint

**Ingredients**  
16oz of peanuts  
3 tbsp of canola oil  
1 tbsp of honey

**Directions**

  1. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade, whiz the peanuts until finely ground and beginning to get pasty. This may take a couple of minutes.
  2. Add oil and honey and pulse about 10 more times until completely incorporated.
  3. Taste for salt or sweetness and add salt or honey to taste.
  4. Put in a 1/2 pint mason jar or similarly sized container and store in the refrigerator.
