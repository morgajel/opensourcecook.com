This bread was really good. Reminded me a lot of pumpkin pie (go figure). Overall, I am definitely making this bread again.

Word of caution, when we first made this, I have two quick settings on my machine and I chose the shortest amount of time (58 mins). This wasn&#8217;t a smart move. We ended up putting it in the oven for another 10-20 minutes and then it came out beautifully. If you have two settings, I would go with the longer time or go with the basic setting (although, I haven&#8217;t tried this on mine yet).

**Ingredients**  
Sugar &#8211; 1 cup  
Pumpkin &#8211; 1 cup canned  
Vegetable oil &#8211; 1/3 cup  
Vanilla &#8211; 1 tsp  
Egg product &#8211; 1/2 cup or 2 eggs  
Flour &#8211; 1-1/2 to 2 cups (all-purpose or bread)  
Baking powder &#8211; 2 tsp  
Salt &#8211; 1/4 tsp  
Cinnamon &#8211; 1 to 2 tsp  
Nutmeg &#8211; 1/4 tsp (do not heap)  
Cloves, ground &#8211; 1/8 tsp (do not heap)

**Directions**

  1. Grease bread machine pan and kneading blade generously with shortening. Measure carefully, placing all ingredients in bread machine pan in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select Quick Bread (80 mins) cycle only. After 3 minutes into cycle, open lid and carefully scrape down sides of pan. Close lid to continue with cycle. Be sure to check your Quick Bread setting. My 58 min setting was too short and my 80 min setting was too long.
  2. Cool baked bread 10 minutes. Remove from pan to wire rack, or follow manufacturer&#8217;s recommendation.
