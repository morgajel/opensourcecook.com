Since I&#8217;ve started taking the whole losing-weight thing seriously, I&#8217;ve been trying protein bars more and while I&#8217;ve found some good ones, I haven&#8217;t been able to find any that are nut-free.  While this may not be a bad thing, it is when your nut allergy son wants one as well. \*grin\* So since I haven&#8217;t been able to find a nut free protein bar, I decided to make my own. I can&#8217;t take full credit though.  My friend Colleen had this yummy protein ball recipe and I decided to build upon that.

The original recipe, while yummy, was a little bland for me. For one it has peanut butter in it and right there means it wasn&#8217;t what I was looking for. The other reason I decided to build upon it was simply because I love chocolate. You can never go wrong with chocolate and peanut butter, so to help with the SunButter taste, I added cocoa powder. Although I haven&#8217;t decided yet if I want to add 2 tbsp of dark cocoa powder or not yet.

**Ingredients:**  
16oz SunButter  
1 tbsp Special Dark Cocoa Powder  
1/4 cup Flaxseed Meal  
1 cup protein powder (This is [the one I used][1])  
1 cup dry milk  
8 tsp Splenda  
2 tsp Glutamine powder  
1/4 quick-cooking oats (or 1/2 cup ground oatmeal)

**Directions:**  
Mix all dry ingredients together. Once everything is blended, add the SunButter.  
Spread the mixture into a 8 3/4&#8243; x 6 1/2 pan and freeze overnight.
