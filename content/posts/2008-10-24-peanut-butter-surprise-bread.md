This is a very peanut buttery bread. Jesse remarked that it was really rich. The [original recipe][1] called for Reese peanut butter cups, but I changed them to the Reese pieces because it added more peanut butter than was needed. In fact, I&#8217;m tempted to take out the Reese pieces and just use chocolate chips. Plus, the cups that are buried in the bread are not that many and it _**is**_ a surprise when you bite into one.

2 cups all-purpose flour  
3/4 cups brown sugar  
1/3 cup chunky peanut butter  
1 cup milk  
2 tbsp vegetable oil  
2 tsp baking powder  
2 eggs  
Reeses Pieces Candy

**Directions:**

  1. Heat oven to 350°F. Generously grease bottoms only of 3 small aluminum-foil loaf pans (5 3/4&#215;3 1/4&#215;2 in) or 1 regular loaf pan. Mix all ingredients except candies; beat with spoon 30 seconds.
  2. Divide batter evenly among pans. Sprinkle candies randomly on batter in each pan, pushing candies halfway into batter. Coarsely chop remaining candies; sprinkle one-third of chopped candies over batter in each pan.
  3. Bake 45 to 50 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes. Loosen sides of loaves from pans; remove from pans to wire rack. Cool completely, about 1 hour.

**Substitution**:  A 9x5x3-inch loaf pan can be used instead of the 3 small pans. Generously grease just the bottom of the pan. Prepare as batter as directed–except pour all of the batter into the pan. Place 15 candies randomly on batter, pushing candies halfway into batter. Coarsely chop remaining candies; sprinkle over batter. Bake as directed.
