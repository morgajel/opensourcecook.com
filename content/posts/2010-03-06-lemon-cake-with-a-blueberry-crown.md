In addition to the all time favorite [Oreo Dark Chocolate Cake][1], I wanted something fruity as well for Ian&#8217;s third birthday party.  So when I came across the Lemon Cake with a Blueberry Crown recipe in the _[The Cake Mix Doctor Returns!][2]_, I figured why not.

According to the author, when she made it, all of the blueberries had sunk to the bottom of her pan during baking &#8211; that didn&#8217;t happen with mine.  Maybe I did something wrong, but it appears as if the blueberries are spread out pretty well.  Either way is good with me, I&#8217;m just saying don&#8217;t expect to see a crown.  Since my top didn&#8217;t come out quite as hers did, I added all of my extra blueberries into the center well to add a little color to the cake.  Plus it gave me something to do with all the extra blueberries (the ones I haven&#8217;t ate yet).

One thing I love about Bundt cakes is they are easy to make.  There&#8217;s really no frosting involved, so they are great as last minute dessert plans.

Vegetable oil spray  
Flour  
1 pkg plain yellow cake  
1-1/2 cups fresh blueberries (plus more if you want to put any in the well)  
1 pkg (3oz) lemon gelatin  
2/3 cup hot water  
2/3 cup vegetable oil  
4 large eggs  
2 medium lemons  
1 to 2 cups confectioners&#8217; sugar, sifted

**Directions:**

  1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Lightly mist a 12-cup Bundt pan with vegetable oil spray, then dust it with flour. Shake out the excess flour and set the pan aside.
  2. Measure out 2 tablespoons of the cake mix and place in a small mixing bowl. Rinse and pat the blueberries dry with paper towels. Add the berries to the small bowl and toss them to coat well with the cake mix. Set the blueberries aside.
  3. Place the remaining cake mix and the lemon gelatin, hot water, oil and eggs in a large mixing bowl and beat with an electric mixer on low speed until the ingredients are just blended &#8211; about 30 seconds. Stop the machine and scrape down the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat until smooth, 2 minutes longer, scraping down the side of the bowl as needed. Fold the blueberries into the batter. Pour the batter into the prepared Bundt pan, smoothing the top with the ru ber spatula, and place the pan in the oven.
  4. Bake the cake until it is golden brown and the top springs back when lightly pressed with a finger, about 40 to 45 minutes. Transfer the Bundt pan to a wire rack and let the cake cool for 15 minutes. Run a long sharp knife around the edges of the cake, shake the pan gently, and invert the cake onto a wire rack. Let the cake cool completely, about 25 minutes longer.
  5. Make the glaze, if using: Rinse and pat the lemons dry with paper towels, then grate enough zest to measure 1 teaspoon. Cut the lemons in half and squeeze the juice into a small bowl; you will need 1/4 cup. Add the lemon zest, then whisk in the confectioners&#8217; sugar until the glaze is smooth.
  6. To glaze the cake, place it on a cake plate and spoon the glaze over the top, allowing it to drip down the sides. Or just dust the cake with confectioners&#8217; sugar. Slice and serve the cake.
