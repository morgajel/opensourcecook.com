This is a great simple recipe for lasagna. It is quick and delicious. By using the sausage instead of the traditional hamburger certainly added great spice to it! A few changes I made was that I added a little bit more of the 5-cheese blend in each layer. Also, I used whole milk ricotta cheese instead of part-skim. In the past, I have had the no boil noodles come out a little hard, so I cooked this for a totally of an hour instead of the 50 minutes and it came out perfect!

**Ingredients**  
1 jar (28 ounces) sausage-flavored pasta sauce  
1 package (20 ounces) frozen sausage breakfast blend  
1 package (8 ounces) shredded Italian 5-cheese blend  
1 container (15 ounces) part-skim ricotta cheese  
12 no-boil lasagna noodles (such as Barilla, from a 9-ounce box)

**Directions**

  1. Heat oven to 350°F. Coat a 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Spread 1/2 cup of the sausage-flavored pasta sauce over bottom of prepared dish. In a large nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add sausage breakfast blend and cook, stirring, 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in remaining pasta sauce.
  2. In a medium-size bowl, stir together 3/4 cup of the shredded cheese, ricotta and 2 tablespoons water. Spread 3 noodles over sauce in dish (do not overlap). Top with half of ricotta mixture, then 3 more noodles. Repeat layering with half the marinara sauce, 3 noodles, remaining ricotta mixture, 3 noodles, remaining sauce and cheese.
  3. Cover dish with nonstick foil; transfer to oven. Bake at 350°F for 30 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake an additional 20 minutes until bubbly. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
