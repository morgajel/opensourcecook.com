What are millet flakes?  Does anyone know?  I came across this recipe in the _[Great Gluten-Free Baking][1]_ by Louise Blair and it sounds really good, except I have no idea what millet flakes are.  So here&#8217;s the recipe and once I find out, and thus try this, I&#8217;ll make sure to update.

**Ingredients:**  
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar  
10 tbsp butter  
2 tbsp light corn syrup  
5 cups millet flakes  
2 tbsp mixed seeds, such as pumpkin and sunflower  
1/2 cup dried mango or apricots, roughly chopped

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Place the sugar, butter and corn syrup in a heavy-based saucepan and heat until melted, then stir in the remaining ingredients.
  2. Spoon the mixture into an 11&#215;7 nonstick baking pan, press down lightly, and place in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Mark to divide into 12 bars, then cool before removing from the pan.
