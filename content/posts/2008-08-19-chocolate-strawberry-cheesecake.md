It&#8217;s was moving day at the job, so Jesse and his colleagues needed some uplifting and since we just got his Aunt Terry&#8217;s chocolate cheesecake recipe, we figured why not. However, I&#8217;m adding a strawberry topping to it instead of the raspberry I&#8217;ve been experimenting with.  We already know the cheesecake is good, or in Jesse&#8217;s words &#8220;a chocolate elemental&#8221;.  However, now we&#8217;re going to see if I can make it and still have it be just as good.  But just so that everything is in one post, here&#8217;s the complete recipe.

**GRAHAM CRACKER CRUST**  
 **Ingredients:**  
8 tbsp butter  
1-1/2 cups crumbs (about 21 squares)  
4-1/2 tbsp sugar  
2-1/4 tsp heaping cocoa

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 375 F.
  2. Mix all ingredients together and pour into spring form pan. Bake at 375 F for 8 minutes.

**CHOCOLATE CHEESECAKE**  
**Ingredients:**  
16oz soft cream cheese  
1 cup mayo (real Hellman’s)  
1 cup sugar  
4 eggs  
2 cups chocolate chips melted  
2 tsp vanilla

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 F.
  2. Beat cheese and mayo at medium speed until smooth. Gradually beat in sugar. Beat in eggs one at a time. Beat in chocolate and vanilla until smooth. Pour into crust, place on a cookie sheet and bake at 350 F for 50 to 55 minutes.

**STRAWBERRY TOPPING**  
**Ingredients:**  
12 oz. pkg. frozen strawberries  
2 tsp. sugar  
1 tsp. cornstarch  
3 tsp. cold water

**Directions:**  
Mash strawberries through strainer, throwing away seeds. Add sugar to strawberries and heat in saucepan to almost boiling. Mix cornstarch with cold water. Add cornstarch mixture little bit at a time to strawberries, stirring constantly, until mixture starts to thicken. Cool in refrigerator and serve with just about anything.
