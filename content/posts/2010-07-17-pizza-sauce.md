Jesse got in the mood to try making his own pizza sauce and this was the result.  It&#8217;s still in the developmental stage, meaning we&#8217;re still playing with the spices, but overall this wasn&#8217;t bad.

Although, I should mention that we haven&#8217;t tried this recently.  Basically, I&#8217;m moving all of our _tried_ recipes from a database to OSC. So I&#8217;m not really sure how much onion was actually included in this recipe.

**Ingredients:**  
1 (15oz) can of tomato sauce  
3/4 tsp garlic powder  
3/4 tsp onion powder  
3/4 tsp basil  
1/4 tsp salt  
3/4 tsp oregano  
1/2 tsp black pepper  
1/2 tsp rosemary  
onions

**Directions:**  
In a medium saucepan, mix all ingredients and bring to a boil. Cover. Reduce heat and simmer about 10 minutes or until the onions are tender.
