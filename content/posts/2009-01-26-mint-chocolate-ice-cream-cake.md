Check out this recipe I found through the Pampered Chef. I haven’t had a chance to try this recipe yet, but I never would have thought to try this with my [spring form pan][1]. It’s definitely a new take on ice cream cakes and I might try this for Ian’s party next month.

**Ingredients:**  
_Crust_  
1 pkg (10oz) fudge-covered mint cookies (about 40 cookies), divided  
2 tbsp butter, melted

_Filling_  
1 qt mint chocolate chip ice cream  
1 qt chocolate ice cream  
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream  
2 tbsp powdered sugar  
1/8 tsp peppermint extract

**Directions:**

  1. For crust, place 25 of the cookies in a resealable plastic bag; crush into fine crumbs using a [baker roller][2]. Place crumbs in [small batter bowl][3]. Add butter; mix well. Press crumb mixture into the bottom of [spring form pan][1]. Place pan in freezer until ready to fill.
  2. Line inside collar of pan with remaining cookies. For filling, place mint chocolate chip ice cream in refrigerator 20 minutes to soften; scoop onto crust. Carefully spread ice cream evenly over crust using [small spreader][4]; cover and freeze 1 hour. Place chocolate ice cream in refrigerator 20 minutes before removing cake from freezer; scoop over mint ice cream. Carefully spread evenly and return to freezer.
  3. Place cream in chilled (2qt) [mixing bowl][5]; beat on high speed with an electric hand mixer until soft peaks form. Add powdered sugar and peppermint extract; continue beating just until stiff peaks form (do not overbeat). Spread cream over chocolate ice cream. Freeze cake until firm, at least 6 hours or overnight.

**Notes:** Stand cookies up against side of pan with rounded sides against the collar. Use the first layer of ice cream to hold the cookies in place.

For easier serving, let cake stand at room temperature 15 minutes or until ice cream is slightly softened. Dip a knife into hot water and wipe dry between cuts.
