This is one of those bread recipes that Jesse gets cravings for every so often. It&#8217;s kind of like a chocolate chip cookie, but better for you since it&#8217;s a bread and not a cookie. ðŸ™‚ It&#8217;s actually really easy to make and there are a lot of times that I don&#8217;t measure the chocolate chips.

I&#8217;ve never tried it (my bread machine died and we haven&#8217;t replaced it yet), but I&#8217;ve been tempted to try this recipe with something other than chocolate chips. For instance, using butterscotch chips or white chocolate chips instead. Jesse would hurt me if I tried&#8230;.just try taking away his chocolate&#8230;.so I haven&#8217;t had the chance yet.

**Ingredients:**  
1-1/2 tsp or 1 pkg dry active yeast  
4 cups bread flour  
2 tbsp brown sugar  
2 tbsp sugar  
1 tsp salt  
4 tbsp softened butter or margarine  
1 egg  
1-1/4 cup warm milk  
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

**Directions:**

  1. Place all ingredients in the pan of the bread machine, except only use 3 cups of the flour, in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select White Bread cycle; press Start.
  2. If your machine has a Fruit setting, add chocolate chips at the signal as well as the remaining flour, or about 5 minutes before the kneading cycle has finished.
