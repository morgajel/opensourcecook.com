This is a semi-quick and easy Mexican recipe that I received and it&#8217;s really good. In the past, I have used half corn tortillas and half flour tortillas. Seems to come out alright. Flour tortillas can be substituted for corn tortillas.

**Ingredients:**  
1 lb ground beef  
1 can of green enchilada sauce  
corn tortillas  
cheddar cheese (at least 1 8oz bag)  
jalape√±os  
onions  
garlic  
salt  
black pepper  
chili powder  
garlic powder  
onion powder

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  2. Saute a little onion, jalapenos, and diced garlic in pan.
  3. Add meat. Season with a dash of cumin, salt, pepper, chili powder, garlic powder, and onion powder.
  4. Drain the grease from the meat.
  5. Mix in bowl 3/4 bag of cheese, half the can enchilada sauce, meat and tortilla strips.
  6. Put in casserole dish. Drizzle remaining can of enchilada sauce over, and cover with rest of cheese. Bake in oven for about 20 minutes.
