I couldn&#8217;t believe I didn&#8217;t have a Banana Bread recipe up on the site.  Well, I&#8217;m rectifying that today.  I&#8217;m sitting on some good bread bananas, so I&#8217;m going to make a batch of Banana Bread.  The recipe I&#8217;m using today comes from [Better Homes & Garden][1], mainly because I can&#8217;t remember which one I normally use.

However, this time, losing a recipe turned out to be a really good thing.  This bread was phenomenal!  Not only was this bread moist and delicious, it&#8217;s still like that after being cut into and left in a ziploc bag over night.  We&#8217;ve been having trouble finding a good recipe and I think we&#8217;ve hit upon a keeper.

I did make a few changes though.  This recipe was originally for 2 loaves, but I only made 1.  Why &#8211; I don&#8217;t like thin bread.  If I had used 2 loaf pans, the bread would have been a little on the thin side, so I just used the one loaf pan and it worked great.  I also doubled the bananas.  I had 2 cups worth, I wasn&#8217;t going to get rid of half of them since that was what the recipe called for.  I think it worked out better with the 2 cups; that could be why the loaf came out  moister too.  I&#8217;m not sure.  Either way, loving this recipe.

When I was looking for a recipe, I came across this [Two-Tone Banana Bread][2] recipe at BH&G and that&#8217;s going to get tried relatively soon.

**Ingredients:**  
2 cups all-purpose flour  
1 cup sugar  
2 teaspoons baking powder  
1/2 teaspoon baking soda  
1/4 teaspoon salt  
2 cups mashed ripe banana  
1/2 cup margarine or butter, softened  
3 tablespoons milk  
2 eggs  
1 cup toasted walnuts

**Directions:**

  1. In a large mixing bowl combine 1 cup of the flour, the sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add mashed ripe banana, margarine or butter, and milk. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed until blended. Beat on high speed for 2 minutes. Add eggs and remaining flour; beat until blended. Stir in walnuts.
  2. Pour into one greased 8x4x2-inch loaf pan. Bake in a 350 degree F oven for 50 to 60 minutes or until a wooden toothpick inserted near the centers comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes. Remove from pans; cool thoroughly on wire racks. Wrap and store overnight, for easier slicing. Makes 1 loaves (16 servings).

**Make-Ahead Tip:** Up to 1 month ahead, make and bake banana bread. Cool completely. Place each loaf in a freezer bag and freeze for up to 1 month. Thaw for 1 hour at room temperature before using.
