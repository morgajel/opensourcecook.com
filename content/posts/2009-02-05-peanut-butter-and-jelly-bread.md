This was better than I thought it would be. It&#8217;s still kind of weird, but I have to admit, I liked the peanut butter and jelly flavoring in the bread. It&#8217;s definitely a bread that doesn&#8217;t need a lot of extra on it, but I could see using jam instead of butter when serving. This is definitely one I&#8217;m going to make again, but using different types of jams.

**Ingredients:**  
1 cup water  
1-1/2 tbsp vegetable oil  
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter  
1 cup strawberry jelly  
1 tbsp sugar  
1 tsp salt  
1 cup wheat flour  
2 cups bread flour  
1-1/2 tsp dry active yeast

**Directions:**  
Place all ingredients into the pan of the bread machine in the order suggested by the manufacturer. Select basic, sweet, or raisin bread setting, select either light or medium crust and press start.
