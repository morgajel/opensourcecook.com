My original thought for this recipe was for two people. Then I saw the turkey breasts. One breast was 15oz and more than enough for both Jesse and I. However, I had the two breasts so I decided to make them together. This recipe should work for as many breasts as you can fit into a 9&#215;13 pan, but I did use an 8&#215;8 pan for this one, so be warned&#8230;you may need to adjust a little.

Be careful when you buy the turkey breasts. The ones I found at Meijer came in some kind of marinade, so I didn&#8217;t add the salt or pepper.

Two turkey breasts make a lot more than I thought it would. It turned out great, but it made a lot of food. One 15oz turkey breast is easily enough for four.

Overall impression &#8211; it&#8217;s a bit salty, but still good.

2 lbs of Turkey breasts  
1 lb of Bacon  
Pepper, black

**Directions:**

  1. Sprinkle turkey with salt and pepper. Place bacon slices side by side on work surface, overlapping slightly. Place 1 turkey breast half, rounded side down, atop bacon. Wrap bacon around turkey breast, stretching slices slightly to cover turkey. Secure with toothpicks to hold bacon in place, then tie with kitchen string to secure bacon. Remove toothpicks. Repeat with second turkey breast half and remaining bacon. Place turkey breasts on large rimmed baking sheet. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and chill.)
  2. Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Place turkey in oven and roast 25 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325Â°F and roast until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of turkey registers 155Â°F, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven; let turkey rest 15 minutes (internal temperature will reach 162Â°F).
  3. Cut turkey breasts crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick slices. Ladle generous amount of Hazelnut Mole on large platter. Arrange turkey slices atop mole; sprinkle with parsley and serve.
