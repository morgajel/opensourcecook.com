I can&#8217;t remember where I found the recipe for Jamaican Coconut Bread, but I like it. It&#8217;s an easy bread recipe and I generally have all of the ingredients ready to go in my pantry. The only thing that could be iffy is the coconut, but who doesn&#8217;t have that on hand?  It&#8217;s sweet in a coconut way and it kind of reminds me of those coconut maroon cookies.

Jesse isn&#8217;t crazy about it, because it&#8217;s &#8220;too spongy&#8221;.  Although, I do have to give him that.Â  This is more of a sponge/pound cake than a bread.  The bread is good, but it&#8217;s not one I would make day after day.  But it&#8217;s definitely a treat when I do make it.

**Ingredients:**  
2 cups Flour, bread  
1-1/2 tsp Baking powder  
1/2 tsp Salt  
1/3 cup Butter or Margarine  
2/3 cup Sugar  
2 Eggs  
1/2 cup Milk  
1 cup Coconut  
Cooking spray

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
  2. Pour the flour, baking powder, and salt into the medium bowl. Mix well with the spoon and set aside.
  3. Place the softened butter and the sugar in the mixing bowl and mix with the electric mixer on low to medium speed until well blended. Add the eggs one at a time and mix well. Then add the milk and mix again. Use the spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl between mixings. Add the flour mixture to the mixing bowl. Mix on low speed until blended, then mix on medium speed until well blended, about a minute or so. Add the coconut and stir gently by hand with the spoon until the flakes are all mixed in.
  4. Spray the loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray. Pour the batter into the pan, using the spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl. Put the pan in the oven and bake for about 55 to 65 minutes.
  5. Check by inserting the blade of the dull knife into the center of the bread. If it comes out completely clean, the bread is done. If it is not completely clean, bake for about 5 to 10 minutes more, checking again after each 5 minutes of baking. Cool the bread in the pan about 5 minutes. Then place the bread on the wire rack to cool. Cut into slices and serve. This bread is sweet, so you won&#8217;t need to spread anything on it.
