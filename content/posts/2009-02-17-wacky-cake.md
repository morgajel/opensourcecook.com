This is another recipe from my Grandmother Birdie. This is one recipe that is easy to make and you will always have the ingredients on hand. There&#8217;s never a reason to say that you didn&#8217;t have what it takes to make a cake on the spur of the moment.

**Ingredients:**  
3 cup flour  
2 cup sugar  
2 tsp baking soda  
1 tsp salt  
6 tbsp cocoa  
2 tbsp vinegar  
2 tsp vanilla  
3/4 cup vegetable oil  
2 cup cold water

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  2. Mix together flour, sugar, baking soda, salt and cocoa. Add vinegar, vanilla, vegetable oil and cold water. Do not mix hard, blend until smooth.
  3. Pour into 9&#215;13 pan and bake 30 minutes.
