This is a great simple casserole. Even though this is for 4 serving, the hubby and I generally have plenty of leftovers.

**Ingredients:**  
1-1/2 cups cooked macaroni  
1/2 (6 ounce) can tuna, drained  
1/2 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup  
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese  
3/4 cup French fried onions

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
  2. In a 9&#215;13-inch baking dish, combine the macaroni, tuna, and soup. Mix well, and then top with cheese.
  3. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 25 minutes, or until bubbly. Sprinkle with fried onions, and bake for another 5 minutes. Serve hot.

**Makes**: 4 Servings
