I love rice krispies treats and when I came across the _Messy Marshmallow Krispies_ in _[Great Gluten-Free Baking][1]_ by Louise Blair, I just had to add them.  They add a nice healthy component to a regular favorite that I can&#8217;t see it not being a hit. Especially since I don&#8217;t see why it wouldn&#8217;t be possible to substitute the apricots (or even the toffee) for other dried fruits.

**Ingredients:**  
5oz gluten-free milk chocolate  
1-1/3 gluten-free toffee bars (about 2oz)  
2 tbsp butter  
1/2 cup dried apricots, chopped  
handful mini marshmallows  
2-3/4 cups gluten-free crisped rice cereal

**Directions:**

  1. Line a baking sheet with wax paper. Place the chocolate, toffee and butter in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water and melt.
  2. Remove the pan from the heat, stir well, then mix in the remaining ingredients. Place spoonfuls of the mixture on the prepared baking sheets and let stand until it sets
