I&#8217;ve been trying a bunch of Pampered Chef recipes and the latest one is the Cheesy Chicken Chilaquiles, which can be found in the [_29 Minutes to Dinner, Volume 2_][1] cookbook.  This actually came out really tasty and I&#8217;m totally going to be adding it to our dinner rotation.  However, I am making a few changes.

The first one being to the cheeses.  The recipe originally calls for 2 cups of Chihuahua cheese and while this was good, it took me a bit to find it in the grocery store.  It&#8217;s one of those imported/exotic cheese and I&#8217;m lucky Meijer carried it. However, the reason I&#8217;m changing it is simply the cost.  I spent close to $8 on the cheese along for this recipe and that&#8217;s ridiculous.  Maybe I&#8217;m being cheap, but why go that route when the Chihuahua cheese can be substituted with Monterey Jack?  For the Queso Fresco (a/k/a Queso Blanco), there&#8217;s a substitute for that as well and I&#8217;ll be using the Farmer&#8217;s Cheese for that the next time around.

For the seasoning, I already had Taco on hand, so I didn&#8217;t see a reason to find the special _Southwestern Seasoning Mix_ that the Pampered Chef sold. Especially not for one recipe.  I don&#8217;t know what makes that certain seasoning special, but Jesse really liked it with the taco.  I did put more than the 1 tbsp the recipe calls for, but I didn&#8217;t put on as much as one normally would with taco seasoning.  Basically, while I was cooking the chicken, I threw in 1/4 cup of water and sprinkled a bunch of the taco seasoning on.  BUT I did do something different while cooking the chicken.  Instead of cooking all the chicken at once, I split it into two batches.  The first had the seasoning/water added straight to the pan; the second one soaked in the seasoning/water while the other was cooking.  I&#8217;m not sure if this made a difference, but I think the chicken came out a little moister than normal because of it.

Oh yeah, one thing I did forget about.  This recipe was designed to be done in the microwave with the Pampered Chef Deep Covered Baker.  However, I&#8217;m not a big fan of microwave cooking &#8211; it takes more effort than throwing something in the oven &#8211; so I didn&#8217;t. Instead, I skipped the first step and just browned the chicken in taco seasoning via skillet and then started with step 2.  I baked the dish in the oven, at 350 degrees F, for about 30-45 minutes.  Since I did still use my deep covered baker, which is stoneware, I kept it in the oven closer to 45 minutes and it came out perfectly.

Otherwise, the family really liked the Chilaquiles.  It&#8217;s definitely something we&#8217;ll be making again.  Jesse&#8217;s only comment: &#8220;they are tasty&#8221;.
