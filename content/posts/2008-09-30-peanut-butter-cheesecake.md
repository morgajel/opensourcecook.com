_**Graham Cracker Pie Crust:**_  
For the graham cracker crust, we’re using the recipe from [Terri’s cheesecake][2], however, we will not be adding the cocoa.

 **Ingredients:**  
8 tbsp butter  
1-1/2 cups crumbs (about 21 squares)  
4-1/2 tbsp sugar

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 375 F.
  2. Mix all ingredients together and pour into spring form pan. Bake at 375 F for 8 minutes.

_**Peanut Butter Cheesecake:**_  
So, just to warn everyone, I basically converted my Chocolate Cheesecake recipe into this Peanut Butter one and this is the first attempt.  So I&#8217;m going to assume there will be some kinks, but we&#8217;ll see how it goes.

Oh yeah, there is definitely some kinks.  Be prepared to see a &#8220;take 2&#8221; of this recipe in the near future.  The first kink we found was sugar.  I forgot that chocolate has a lot of its own sugar already in it, so it wasn&#8217;t in the original recipe.  We think we found the right amount of sugar, but we&#8217;ll have to wait until it&#8217;s done to be sure.  However, the biggest problem I came across was the amount of peanut butter needed.  Four cups of peanut butter makes for a lot of cheesecake and the amounts just have to get changed.  This thing is huge.  I mean seriously massive.  I already adjusted the cooking time to 65 minutes just due to the size.  I&#8217;ll know for sure once I get it out.

 **Ingredients:**  
2 cups peanut butter  
3 &#8211; 8oz pkgs cream cheese, softened  
3/4 cup sugar  
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened  
1/3 cup milk  
4 eggs  
1 egg yolk

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 F.
  2. Microwave the peanut butter and butter together for 1 minute.  Stir.
  3. Beat melted peanut butter, cream cheese, butter or margarine, and milk in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer on medium to high speed until combined. Add whole eggs and egg yolk all at once. Beat on low speed just until combined.
  4. Pour filling into the springform pan. Place the pan in a shallow baking pan on the oven rack. Bake in a 350 degree F oven about 65 minutes or until 1 to 2 inches of outside edge appear set when shaken gently.
  5. Remove springform pan from baking pan. Cool cheesecake in pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Use a small metal spatula to loosen cheesecake from sides of pan. Cool 30 minutes more. Remove sides of pan. Cool 1 hour; cover and chill at least 4 hours.
