While looking for some grillable pork recipes, I stumbled across this one over at [Allrecipes][2]. The recipe was created by [Andrea Bolden][3], but I&#8217;m going to make a few changes.

The one thing I initially missed when I was first wrapping these was that you have to make sure you wait until AFTER you&#8217;ve included the seasoning.  I started wrapping the first one when I realized &#8220;where&#8217;s the soy sauce?&#8221;

One major change both Jesse and I agree on is that something sweet needs to be added and the broccoli needs to go.  I don&#8217;t know if I didn&#8217;t put in enough peppers (since I never measure those) or what, but the pork loin was a little bland.  Since I&#8217;m not usually a fan of pork to begin with, to me, this wasn&#8217;t all that great.  I see potential though.  Ian started eating it once I added honey, so I&#8217;m thinking next time around I&#8217;m going to add some honey to the soy sauce and sesame oil.  How much, I&#8217;m not sure yet.

1 pound pork tenderloin, sliced  
2 cups sliced carrots  
1 (8oz) can sliced water chestnuts, drained  
1 medium green pepper, julienned  
2 green onions, sliced  
1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce  
4 tsp sesame oil  
1 tsp ground ginger  
Hot cooked rice

**Directions:**

  1. Divide pork, broccoli, carrots, water chestnuts, green pepper and onions evenly among four pieces of double-layered heavy-duty foil, **but do not fold close**. Combine the soy sauce, sesame oil and ginger; drizzle over pork and vegetables. Fold foil around filling and seal tightly.
  2. Grill, covered, over medium heat for 8-10 minutes or until vegetables are tender and pork is no longer pink. Serve with rice if desired.
