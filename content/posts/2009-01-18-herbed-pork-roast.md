I have only made this 1 time, however, the hubby and I was very impressed. This is certainly a meal that will be repeated.

**Ingredients:**  
1-3/4 teaspoons sugar  
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram  
1/2 teaspoon rubbed sage  
1/4 teaspoon salt  
1/8 teaspoon celery seed  
1/8 teaspoon ground mustard  
1/8 teaspoon pepper  
1-1/2 pounds boneless pork loin roast

**Directions:**

  1. Combine the first seven ingredients; rub over roast. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.
  2. Place roast on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees for 2-1/2 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 160-170 degrees. Let stand for 15 minutes before slicing. Refrigerate or freeze remaining pork (may be frozen for up to 3 months).

**Makes:** 4 servings
