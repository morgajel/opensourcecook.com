So this was a complete improvisation. My original thought was to make my [Chicken Rice Skillet][1], but then I realized that I didn&#8217;t have the rice. So this recipe was born. It&#8217;s nothing spectacular, but it smells good. I tend to just throw things in when I&#8217;m cooking and since I was improving, I threw in some garlic. It helps lower cholesterol and since Jesse&#8217;s is up there, I&#8217;ve been making a lot of things with garlic these days. The jar of red sauce I used was something I had in the pantry. It happens to be an organic Italian Herb made by Muir Glen, but any kind of sauce will do.

It doesn&#8217;t look the greatest, but according to Jesse &#8220;It&#8217;s not as disgusting as I thought it would be&#8221;. The picture is&#8217;nt all that great either. I took it off of Ian&#8217;s plate, which also happens to be his high chair tray. My dishes are white as well, so I doubt I would have gotten a great picture from that as well. For something coming out of &#8220;oh no I don&#8217;t have any rice&#8221;, it&#8217;s not bad. It&#8217;s your basic pasta primavera ripoff.

Overall, not a bad dish. One thing I would do different, I served the dish by spooning the sauce over the pasta. Next time, Jesse recommends mixing the pasta in with the sauce before serving.
