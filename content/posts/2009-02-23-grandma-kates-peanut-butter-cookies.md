This was my Grandma Kate&#8217;s recipe. 

**Ingredients:**  
1/2 cup brown sugar  
1/2 cup white sugar  
1/2 cup oleo  
3/4 cup peanut butter  
1/2 tsp vanilla  
1 egg  
1/2 tsp salt  
1 tsp baking powder  
1-1/2 cup flour

**Directions:**  
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  
Mix all ingredients well – leaving flour the last ingredient to be mixed.  
Roll dough between hands forming a 1 inch ball, place on lightly greased cookie sheet. Flatten with a floured fork using a criss-cross pattern.  
Bake for 10-12 minutes
