What&#8217;s cocoquino? It&#8217;s a portmanteau of coco and quinoa- a wheat-free version of coco wheats that I tried making for Simon.

Ingredients:  
1C quinoa  
2C water  
1C milk  
1/4C brown sugar  
pinch of salt  
1tsp vanilla  
1tbsp coco powder  
1tbsp butter

Directions:  
Bring water and salt to a boil.  
Add quinoa, sirring often for 10 minutes on medium heat.  
At this point, the quinoa should start thickening.  
Add half the milk, reduce heat, stir often.  
after another 5 minutes, add second half of the milk, vanilla, brown sugar,butter and coco powder.  
Stir until thickened, remove from heat and let cool.

The texture is similar to soggy sesame seeds; I suspect if you add another cup of water and let it cook longer, it may soften. 

Quinoa has a slightly nutty flavor, and the smell reminds me of nobake cookies.
