This recipe originally came from [Betty Crocker][1], but it is so easy to make, that you can easily make it your own. I know I did.  One of the things I added was green peppers.  For some reason, I love cooking with green peppers lately.  They just add a flavor that seems to always work.   I also used Colby Jack shredded cheese instead of Cheddar since that is what I had on hand.

That&#8217;s the other beautiful part, I had all the ingredients in my cabinet.  I was looking for something easy for dinner tonight since I wasn&#8217;t going to be here and we had hamburger so I thought this would work.  I love finding recipes where I have all the ingredients already and I don&#8217;t have to go out shopping for them.

Jesse wasn&#8217;t too crazy about this recipe, but I don&#8217;t think he would have a problem eating it again.  Especially if I continue to tweak it.  I thought it kind of tasted like a cheeseburger (bun included) but as a casserole and Jesse thought it tasted more like a casserole.  Either way, it was easy to make, I had all the ingredients in my pantry, and I can easily add more ingredients (i.e. green peppers, jalapeños, tomatoes, etc.) if I want to.  To me, that makes a recipe a definite keeper.

Also, for anyone looking to make this for only two people, Betty&#8217;s [already done the work][2].  I also found recipes for a [Taco Pie][3] and a [Chicken Taco Pie][4] that I think I&#8217;m going to try.<img decoding="async" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right;" src="http://www.bettycrocker.com/images/beautyshots/r35487fp.jpg" alt="" />
