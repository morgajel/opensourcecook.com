This recipes comes from Faye Johnson, in the [_Essential Game Bird Recipes_][1] by Pheasants Forever.

I&#8217;m actually wondering if this would be good for pheasant as well.

**Ingredients:**  
1 whole duck or goose breast, uncooked and finely chopped or ground.  
2 to 4 jalapeno peppers, finely chopped  
1 large spanish onion, finely chopped  
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped  
3 tbsp finely chopped fresh cilantro  
6 kaiser buns, toasted

**Directions:**  
Combine meat, jalapenos, onions, garlic and cilantro. Divide into six patties. Refrigerate, covered, for 4 hours. Grill patties on hot grill to desired doneness.
