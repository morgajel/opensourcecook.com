**Ingredients:**  
2 cups all-purpose flour  
1-1/4 cups sugar  
3 heaping tbsp cocoa  
2 tsp baking soda  
1 cup water  
1-1/2 tsp vanilla  
1 cup mayonnaise

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix all dry ingredients. Add water and vanilla; stir well. Fold in mayonnaise. Pour into greased 13&#215;9 pan (or you can spray with pam and sprinkle with cocoa). Bake for 15 minutes.

**Tip:** Use a glass or plastic mixing bowl, do not use metal. Also follow this the way it reads and don&#8217;t go out of order.
