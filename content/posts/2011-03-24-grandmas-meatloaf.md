My grandmother&#8217;s recipe, this is a fairly quick and easy meatloaf to make and I typically always have the ingredients on hand.

**Ingredients:**  
1 lb Hamburger  
1/2 cup ketchup  
1/4 cup onions  
3 eggs  
salt to taste  
pepper to taste  
about 2 cups instant oats or cracker crumbs

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  2. Mix together leaving cracker crumbs for last. Add enough cracker crumbs to thickness desired.
  3. Bake for 45 minutes or until meatloaf comes away from pan.
