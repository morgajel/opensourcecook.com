Mmm&#8230;.I recently posted a Duck or Goose Burger recipe and then I came across this one.  Has  potential.  This one doesn&#8217;t say to grill it, but I&#8217;m sure you can.

2 cups chopped, cooked pheasant  
1 egg, slightly beaten  
1 tbsp finely chopped onion  
1/2 tsp salt  
1/4 tsp pepper  
1/2 cup mayonnaise  
2/3 cup sliced celery  
Bread or cracker crumbs  
1 tbsp melted butter

**Directions:**  
Mix all ingredients except crumbs and melted butter. Chill. Shape into six patties; roll in crumbs. Melt butter in skillet at low heat. Brown patties for about 10 minutes. Serve on a bun with your favorite toppings.
