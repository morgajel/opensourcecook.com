The weather has been getting hot lately, so Jesse and I have been looking for dinner meals that we don&#8217;t necessarily have to cook or anything we can throw on the grill. One thing we found that works beautifully&#8230;.corn on the cob. It&#8217;s actually really easy. Wrap the ingredients in tin foil and stick it on the grill. Thirty minutes later and it&#8217;s done. We grilled a couple of ears last night along with a really nice cut of steak and dinner was a success.

We&#8217;re still looking for some really good meal ideas that are cool or can be made on the grill.Ã‚ So if anyone has any suggestions, we&#8217;re all ears.

**Ingredients:**  
1 Corn on the Cob in the husk  
1 tbsp of Butter or Margarine  
3 tbsp crushed ice  
tin foil

**Directions:**

  1. Have enough tin foil to wrap each ear twice. Place all ingredients in tin foil and wrap.
  2. Grill for 30 minutes.
