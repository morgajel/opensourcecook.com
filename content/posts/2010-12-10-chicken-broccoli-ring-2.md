The one change I did this time around was I used bigger crescent rolls.  The one thing I remembered from the first time was that it seemed like there wasn&#8217;t enough crescent roll. I could be wrong, but when I saw the bigger packs, I went for those instead.  I want to say the bigger package has fewer crescent rolls (only 6 instead of 8), but they spread out a lot easier and it didn&#8217;t seem like I was trying to squeeze in more rolls.

A second change is I didn&#8217;t use plain chicken.  Before you make the ring, you have to brown the chicken in a skillet.  This time, I mixed together some olive oil and Tastefully Simple&#8217;s [Garlic Garlic][2] and added a bit to the skillet.  Then once the chicken breasts were added, I brushed both sides with the garlic mixture.  I&#8217;m not sure how much of a flavor this added, but I know it smelled good.   I want to say I only used about 2tbsp of the [Garlic Garlic][2] and 2-4 tbsp of the olive oil. The mixture was on the thick side and I wanted it that way so it wouldn&#8217;t run off the breasts as much once I did start brushing it on.

I remembered the cheese this time!  I didn&#8217;t even add extra either, so we&#8217;ll have to see what the guys at Jesse&#8217;s work says with the cheese added.  I also added onion to the mixture this time.  I don&#8217;t know what it is, but I like adding onion to anything I make.  I think it just enhances the flavor more or it could just be me.  Who knows.

I can&#8217;t remember if I did it this way last time or if it was a lot more half-hearted, but when brushing egg whites onto the ring, make sure you do the entire ring, not just the top.  After 30 minutes, the ring can out so beautiful that it shocked me.  I don&#8217;t remember it being this evenly browned.

I think those are the major changes I did this time around.  I personally prefer doing the ring, but this recipe can also be made using the wreath and braid recipes.  Directions for these are [here][1].

2 pkg (10oz) refrigerated crescent rolls  
2 cups coarsely chopped cooked chicken  
1-1/2 cups coarsely chopped broccoli  
1 cup shredded cheddar  
1/2 cup diced onion  
1/2 cup diced bell pepper  
1/3 cup mayonnaise  
1 tsp Dill mix or dried dill weed  
dash tsp salt  
1 garlic clove, pressed  
1 egg white, lightly beaten  
1/4 cup slivered almonds

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a mixing bowl, combine chicken, broccoli, cheese, bell pepper and onion; mix well.  In a small dish, mix together the mayonnaise, seasoning mix, salt and garlic; mix well.   Combine the two mixtures.
  2. Unroll crescent rolls and separate into 16 triangles.  Arrange triangles, slightly overlapping, in a circle on a round stone with wide ends 4 inches from the edge of baking stone.  Points will extend off the edge of the baking stone.  Using a baker&#8217;s rolling pin (or something small), roll the wide ends of dough toward center to create a 5-inch opening.  Make sure you mesh the seams together so it&#8217;s all one big piece of dough.
  3. Using the a large (3tbsp) scoop, scoop filling evenly over dough in a continuous circle.  Bring points of triangles up over filling and tuck under dough at center to form a ring &#8211; the filling will show.  Brush with egg white.  Sprinkle with almonds.  Bake 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.
