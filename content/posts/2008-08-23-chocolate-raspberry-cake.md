I have this lasagna pan that is bigger than a standard 9&#215;13 that I tend to use since I get a bigger cake, but thinner layers. It works really well and I finally found a cake carrier that the cake will fit in. Since the pan is bigger, I bake the cakes for about 30 minutes and then I add minutes as needed. There are times when I have had to add a few minutes and others when I haven&#8217;t.

On the raspberry mousse, I did increase the whipped cream by A LOT. Originally, the recipe only called for 4 cups, but after looking at the amount it gave me, I wasn&#8217;t really satisfied with it. So I added more whipped cream and I added a dash of raspberry extract so the flavor wouldn&#8217;t get overpowered by the cream. Something else I did was to double the raspberries. Well, I shouldn&#8217;t say I doubled it, but I added more raspberries after the mousse had been sitting in the refrigerator for a couple of hours. It had time to firm up a little and the added raspberries gave it more color and a strong raspberry flavor. This step is completely optional, but I think it will come out better since I doubled the whipped cream.

After everything was said and done, this cake came out being awesome. The raspberry favoring wasn&#8217;t overpowering and there was enough of a contrast that really made the cake.

**Ingredients:**  
2 packages of Dark Chocolate cake mix  
3 packages of whipped chocolate frosting  
24 oz frozen raspberries  
1 tablespoon unflavored gelatin  
1 tablespoon lemon juice  
28oz whipped cream  
1/4 cup sugar  
raspberry extract

**Directions:**

  1. Prepare cake batter according to package directions, however, add a little raspberry extract to the batter. Then bake both cakes according to box directions. Cool completely.
  2. Take one cake and level the top off, making it flat. Layer the raspberry mousse lavishly onto cake. Once completed, gently add the second cake on top of mousse.
  3. Frost all sides of the cake.
  4. _Raspberry Mousse_ &#8211;  <span class="bodytext">In a saucepan combine 12 oz of raspberries and sugar. Heat and stir over medium heat until the mixture turn to liquid. Stir in gelatin.
