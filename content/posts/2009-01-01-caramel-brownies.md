The original recipe came from Kathy Tarkiewicz.  She made it last night &#8211; very yummy! This was yummy! The brownies are not very thick &#8211; they were a good size, however, i think when i make it again, i will double the ingredients &#8211; possibly. Jay even liked the brownies and he typically does not like anything else in brownies. It is a bit rich as well. Let me know what you think if/when you make this.

**Ingredients**  
50 Light Caramels (14oz. bag)  
2/3 cup evaporated milk  
3/4 cup chocolate chips, melted  
1 pkg. German Chocolate Cake Mix  
3/4 cup margarine, melted (1-1/2 sticks)  
3/4 cup chopped nuts (optional &#8211; we didn&#8217;t add them)

**Directions:**

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease and flour 9&#215;13 pan.
  2. Melt caramels over low heat with 1/3 cup of evaporated milk. Set aside.
  3. Combine cake mix, 1/3 evaporated milk, margarine, and nuts. Stir until dough sticks together. Press 1/2 of dough into pan (reserve the rest for the top).  Bake for 6 minutes.
  4. Remove from oven and spread melted chocolate chips over cooked dough. Spread caramel mixture over chocolate chips. Bake 15-18 minutes. Cool slightly and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
